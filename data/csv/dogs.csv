Westerners carelessly hung the name “terrier” on this typically Asian dog, and it stuck. An ancient breed developed in the splendid isolation of the Lost Valley, TTs are among several Tibetan dogs associated with Buddhist monasteries and the Dalai Lama. TTs are best known as companions and watchdogs, but during their long history they’ve worked as herders and flock guardians.","Black,Black & White,Black White & Gold,Brindle,Gold,Gold & White,Sable,White,White & Black,White & Gold,Black & Brindle,Black & Brown,Black & Gold,Black & White Brindle,Black Brown & White,Brindle & White,Brown,Brown & White,Fawn,Fawn & White,Gray,Gray & White,Red,Red & White,Sable & White,Silver,Silver & Black,Silver & White,Sable,Ticked"
border_collie,Border Collie,"19-22 inches (male), 18-21 inches (female)",30-55 pounds,12-15 years,Sheepdogs and Cattledogs (except Swiss Cattledogs),great britain,"During the glory days of the Roman Empire, successive emperors drew up plans to invade and conquer Britain. But, for various reasons—uprisings in other parts of the empire or shifting political situations—the plans were shelved. Finally, in the year 43, the emperor Claudius fulfilled this long-held dream of conquest.The Roman occupation of Britain had a great influence on virtually every aspect of British life. This included dog breeding. The occupying legions brought along their own food source: livestock. And where livestock goes, herding dogs are sure to follow. The large, heavy-boned herding dogs imported by the Romans remained a fixture on the British landscape for more than three centuries.During the long, slow dissolution of the Roman Empire, fierce Viking raiders took their turn invading Britain. They, too, brought along their dogs. These were smaller, quicker, spitz-type herders, progenitors of such contemporary breeds as the Icelandic Sheepdog. Crosses between the old Roman dogs and the Viking spitzes produced compact and agile herders, well equipped to work stock in the hilly, rocky highlands of Scotland and Wales. Thus began the history of the Border Collie.Borders have been called the world’s greatest herders, and anyone who’s seen them work—with their sweeping outruns, their stealthy crouching and creeping, and their explosive bursts of focused energy—would have to agree. When shepherds dream of the perfect dog, you can bet it’s a Border.As immortalized in the movie “Babe,” Borders have dominated competitive sheepdog trials in the British Isles for more than a hundred years. Borders also rule the championship levels of the fast-paced sport of agility, and they routinely top lists of world’s smartest dog breeds.The Border Collie joined the AKC Herding Group in 1995.","Black,Blue,Brindle,Gold,Lilac,Red,Sable,White & Black,White & Blue,White & Blue Merle,White & Red,White & Red Merle,Seal,Slate,White & Gold,White & Sable,White & Seal"

clumber,Clumber,"18-20 inches (male), 17-19 inches (female)","70-85 pounds (male), 55-70 pounds (female)",10-12 years,Retrievers,great britain,"Early Clumber history is, one researcher writes, “lost in a tangled web of folklore and misinformation.” We can pick up a reliable trail in the late 1700s at Nottinghamshire, England. There, the Duke of Newcastle and his gamekeeper perfected a burly spaniel named for the duke’s vast estate, Clumber Park.Clumbers became a favorite of the many gamebird hunters among the area’s titled families and landed gentry. Since the duke’s day Clumbers have been popular with British royals, including Edward VII and George V (an important Clumber breeder in his day). The breed has been described by its partisans as naughty, mischievous, stubborn, affectionate, and entertaining, but through it all the Clumber retains the touch of regal dignity that marks him as a companion of crowned heads.As accessories of the British upper crust, Clumbers were popular subjects for leading sporting artists and portrait painters during the heyday of the British aristocracy. Seen today, these pictures show that the breed has changed but little in all the years since.Clumbers were on the scene for the very first British dog shows, held in the mid-1800s. They were introduced to America, by way of Canada, around the same time. Careful studbooks were kept on the breed in America even before the AKC was established, and the Clumber was among the AKC’s nine charter breeds when the organization was founded in 1884.",White
pembroke,Pembroke,10-12 inches,"up to 30 pounds (male), up to 28 pounds (female)",12-13 years,Sheepdogs and Cattledogs (except Swiss Cattledogs),great britain,"In medieval times, the kings of Europe advertised their majesty to their subjects and visiting emissaries by the richness of their possessions. Carpets, textiles, and tapestries were important factors in these displays of conspicuous consumption.The era’s best weavers were centered in Flanders, now northern Belgium. It was common for monarchs to stage talent raids to induce Flemish weavers to relocate to their kingdoms. So it was that in the year 1107, Henry I of Britain invited a community of these master craftsmen to live and work in southwestern Wales. The weavers accepted Henry’s invitation and brought all they needed to re-create their agrarian way of life in their new homeland. This included the dogs they bred to herd cattle and sheep. These sturdy, short-legged herders were the foundation for the breed we now know as the Pembroke Welsh Corgi.The Pembroke has been a distinctly separate breed from his cousin the Cardigan Welsh Corgi since the late 1800s, but the two breeds often intermingled in the old Welsh breeding centers of Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire. Today, the most noticeable differences between the breeds are the ears (the Pembroke’s are pointed and erect, the Cardi’s rounded) and the tail (the Cardi tale is much longer than the Pembroke’s).The world’s most famous Pembroke fan is Elizabeth II. The queen got her first Pembroke, Dookie, in 1933 and has not been without one or more since.","Black & Tan,Fawn,Red,Sable"

The mystery of its beginnings gave rise to charming blarney about leprechauns, shipwrecks, and other fanciful origin tales. We do know that Kerries were hardworking all-around farm dogs, cherished for their versatility. The breed was a mascot for patriots in the struggle for Irish independence, and since the early 20th century they’ve been top winners in the show ring.

bedlington_terrier,Bedlington Terrier,15-17.5 inches,17-23 pounds,11-16 years,Terriers,great britain,"They look like lambs in the show ring, and they’re as gentle as lambs around the house. So, it comes as a bit of shock to discover that Bedlingtons spent most of the 1800s doing dirty, and sometimes deadly, work. Created in the Northumberland mining shire that gave the breed its name, Bedlingtons were a workingman’s dog expected to be versatile enough to be employed as coalmine ratters, varmint killers, and pit fighters. The breed acquired the nickname “Gypsy Dog” because it was used by the wandering Romanies as a stealthy poaching partner. An observer of the breed’s formative years wrote that the Bedlington was the “smartest and quickest of our terriers.”The first dog identified as a Bedlington Terrier, named Piper, was bred in 1825. It was said that Piper was so game that he was still dispatching badgers at age 14, and nearly blind and toothless. The nail makers of Bedlington took a fancy to the breed and became known for their plucky terriers. The shire’s miners and nailers wagered their salaries on epic dogfights, pitting their terriers against each other. A breed historian noted, “Bedlingtons were never a mischief maker, but once he started fighting, it was to the death.”Happily for us, Bedlingtons turned out to be even better lovers than fighters. Thanks to their ample charms, Bedlingtons eventually rose from coalmines and nail factories to the manor house. British elites found Bedlingtons to be bighearted, lovable companions, as well as attractive ornaments to their style-conscious lifestyle.Refinement and consistency in the breed began with the formation of England’s National Bedlington Terrier Club in 1877. Nine years later, the AKC registered its first Bedlington. Today’s citizens of Bedlington, England, are still proud of their most famous export. Bedlington’s Northern League soccer team is called the Terriers, and the town has recently installed park benches shaped like its fleecy mascot breed.","Blue,Blue & Tan,Liver,Liver & Tan,Sandy,Sandy & Tan"
walker_hound,Walker Hound,"22-27 inches (male), 20-25 inches (female)",50-70 pounds,12-13 years,Not recognized,United States,"Let’s unpack the name a word at a time. “Treeing” refers to a hound trailing the scent of his quarry until the quarry scurries up a tree for safety, with the hound camping out below and barking, vigorously and distinctively, for as long as it takes for the gun-toting hunter to arrive. “Walker” is Thomas Walker, of Virginia, who in the mid-1700s was a pivotal figure of the breed’s early development. “Coonhound” is a dog developed to “tree” raccoons and, sometimes, bigger game.The Treeing Walker Coonhound was developed from the Walker Foxhound, which evolved from the Virginia Hounds that descended from the earliest English Foxhounds that were brought to America. Originally classified as an English Coonhound, the Treeing Walker’s breeders broke away from the English version in 1945 and bred to retain the qualities they desired. It is a fast, hot-nosed, sensible hunter, with a clear, ringing bugle voice or a steady, clear chop with changeover at the tree. It locates its quarry quickly and has superb endurance and treeing ability. Known to range widely, it may leave the original track if it picks up a stronger scent. Extremely competitive because of its speed, the Treeing Walker’s reputation grew as night-hunts achieved popularity.Today the Treeing Walker retains the same color and similar conformation to the Walker Foxhound and is occasionally described as a trailing hound with treeing instinct.","Black,Tri-Colored,White,Blanket-Back,Saddle-Back"
black-and-tan_coonhound,Black-And-Tan Coonhound,"25-27 inches (male), 23-25 inches (female)",65-110 pounds,10-12 years,Scent hounds and related breeds,united states of america,"The raccoon is an unsung hero of American history. These plump, nocturnal creatures were a steady source of meat, fur, and fat for settlers who tamed the wild continent.The frontiersmen who lit out for the western and southern territories in post-Revolutionary times hoping to carve their fortune out of the wilderness faced a challenge: There was no dog breed fully equipped to hunt raccoon. The closest thing at hand were the foxhounds used by the landed gentry of the South on traditional English-style foxhunts. But foxhounds, bred to run at straightaway over the gently rolling acres of a plantation, were unsuited to the task. What America required was a whole new hound.With typical Yankee ingenuity, the frontiersmen crossed European hounds—foxhounds and Bloodhounds were surely in the mix—to create a uniquely American breed type, the coonhound. These hounds trail raccoon scent through moonlit woods and swamps until they “tree” their quarry, bawling along the way in a clear, musical voice to mark their location to rifle-toting hunters.To this day, the activity of treeing raccoons with hounds is called a “nite” hunt, with the intentional misspelling meant by the sport’s devotees as a tip of the coonskin cap to the untutored backwoodsmen who developed the B&T and America’s other coonhound breeds. Among the early coonhound enthusiasts was the legendary explorer, huntsman, and “cooner” Daniel Boone, whose beloved Kentucky became a hub of coonhound breeding. Truly, the B&T and his coonhound kinfolk are America’s dogs.In 1945, the B&T became the first coonhound breed registered by the AKC.",Black & Tan
malamute,Malamute,"25 inches (male), 23 inches (female)","85 pounds (male), 75 pounds (female)",10-14 years,Spitz and primitive types,united states of america,"The Alaskan Malamute is among the oldest of the sled dog breeds of the Arctic. They are believed to be a descendant of the domesticated wolf-dogs who accompanied the Paleolithic hunters that crossed the land bridges of the Bering Strait and migrated into North America roughly 4,000 years ago.The breed’s name is derived from the Mahlemiut, a nomadic Inuit tribe that resided in Kotzebue Sound in northwestern Alaska. The dog the Mahlemiut people developed was primarily a sledge dog, created to work in packs to haul heavy loads at low speeds over long distances. However, they were also used for carrying packs in the summer, locating seal breathing holes in the ice, and distracting bears on hunts. Other Arctic dog breeds, like the Siberian Husky, pull lighter loads on sleds at faster speeds. Huskies are racers; Malamutes are freighters.The Inuit culture spans from the coasts of Alaska to the coasts of Greenland. Because of this distance, different strains developed in the Malamute breed. The AKC recognized the original Kotzebue strain in 1935. After WWII, the breed’s numbers plummeted until there were very few dogs registered. In response, during the late 1940s and ’50s, the AKC opened the studbook to include the M’Loot and Hinman strains as well. Today, the Malamute’s gene pool is made up of all three of these strains, with Ch. Toro of Bras Coupe being the first dog to unite them.","Agouti & White,Black & White,Blue & White,Gray & White,Red & White,Sable & White,Seal & White,Silver & White,White"

In fact, they’re among the oldest of all British breeds. The word “corgi,” originally “kergie,” is ancient Celtic for “dog,” and historians surmise that ancient corgis were brought from Central Europe to Wales by the Celts during their mass migrations to Britain around 1200 BC. We can say with some certainty, however, that corgis were driving Welsh herds 1,000 years ago.Cardigans are built low to the ground to best nip at the heels of cattle and avoid being kicked. (Dogs who drive herds to pasture or market in this heel-nipping style are called heelers.) The adaptable Cardigan did double duty on long cattle drives, moving the herd by day and serving as a flock guardian at night. During the breed’s long history, Cardigans have at various times worked as an all-around farm dog, hunting partner, family protector, and athlete. Cardigans were long associated with Britain’s crofters (tenant farmers) who depended on their dogs to help scratch a meager living out of the pasture land permitted them by the crown.Cardigans and Pembrokes were at one time freely interbred, and until as late as 1934 they were considered a single breed in the United Kingdom. The first pair of breeding Cardigans arrived in the United States in June 1931. The AKC granted full recognition to the breed four years later.","Black & White,Blue Merle & White,Brindle & White,Red & White,Sable & White,Brindle Merle & White,Gray & White,Liver & White,Red Merle & White,Sable Merle & White,Black Mask & Ticked,Brindle Points & Ticked,Tan Points & Ticked,Ticked"

The breed earned its fame as shipboard exterminators on the canals that crisscrossed the Low Countries. The little black avenger of the Belgian dockyards was also a fearless watchdog on barges and in city shops.

They were so successful that, to this day, GSPs are among the top-winning breeds in competitive hunting events. The German bird-dog tradition dates to at least the 1700s, with master breeders experimenting with tracking hound–pointing dog crosses in the quest for a quick but powerful hunter possessing plenty of nose and versatility. It comes as no surprise to learn that a key player in the early development of this breed of noble bearing was himself a nobleman, Prince Albrecht zu Solms-Braunfels. The prince and his fellow enthusiasts succeeded beyond their wildest imaginings in creating a do-it-all hunting dog. Here, a breed historian ticks off the GSP’s credentials: “a staunchly pointing bird dog; a keen-nosed night trailer; a proven duck dog; a natural retriever on land or water, with pleasing conformation and markings, and great powers of endurance; and an intelligent family watchdog and companion.” The GSP has been hunted with success on a variety of quarry: gamebirds, possum, rabbit, raccoon, and even deer. With his webbed feet and sleek but sturdy construction, the GSP burnishes his résumé as one of dogdom’s finest swimmers. Emblematic of the breed’s eager versatility was Marvin, a GSP from North Carolina, who in late 2013 achieved his 75th AKC title.","Black,Black & White,Liver,Liver & White,White & Liver,Patched,Patched & Ticked,Ticked"

For the 50 years between 1840 and 1890, Tweedmouth kept scrupulous records of breedings effected to create an ideal gundog for use at his Guisachan estate in the Highlands, Inverness-shire, Scotland. Tweedmouth wanted a dog suited to the rainy climate and rugged terrain of the area, so he crossed his “Yellow Retriever” with a breed that is now extinct, the Tweed Water Spaniel. Irish Setter and Bloodhound were also added to the mix.“Through several generations of clever breeding,” an admiring historian wrote, “Tweedmouth created a consistent line of exceptional working retrievers.” With a little more refinement after Tweedmouth’s time, the Golden Retriever came forth as an enduring gift to dogkind from a hunt-happy aristocrat.The Golden was first seen at a British dog show in 1908, and good specimens of the breed began arriving in America, by way of Canada, at about the same time. Sport hunters appreciated the breed’s utility, show fanciers were enthralled by their beauty and dash, and all were impressed by the Golden’s sweet, sensible temperament.The Golden was popular from the beginning of its American history, but the breed’s popularity really took off in the 1970s, the era of President Gerald Ford and his beautiful Golden named Liberty.",Golden
afghan_hound,Afghan Hound,25-27 inches,50-60 pounds,12-15 years,Sighthounds,afghanistan,"This is a very old breed. In fact, some authorities maintain that the Afghan Hound is the oldest breed of purebred dogs. (An ancient myth says that a brace of Afghan Hounds represented the canine species on Noah’s Ark.) Because the breed predates written history by a few thousand years, and because it was developed in some of the world’s most remote locales, its exact time and place of origin within the vast area that is now Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan will never be known. What we do know is that for centuries Afghans were rugged, fleet-footed hunting companions and status symbols of royals, tribal chieftains, and aristocrats in Asia’s mountain kingdoms. Afghan Hounds belong to the subcategory of hound breeds known as sighthounds, dogs who rely on their panoramic vision and explosive speed to spot and pursue their prey.A fixture of Eastern culture since the dawn of civilization, the Afghan hound didn’t make its entrance on the stage of Western history until the late 1800s. It was then that English officers returning from the British Empire’s farthest corners introduced the breed to Europe. By the early 1900s, the Afghan was a preferred breed of the British gentry.The AKC registered its first of the breed in 1927, but not until the early ’30s did the breed really catch on with U.S. breeders and owners. Among the most important dogs of those early years in America were a breeding pair imported from England by Zeppo Marx, the youngest of the wacky Marx Brothers. Since then, the Afghan’s fame in America has been built on his sterling qualities as a pet and his show-stopping presence in the ring.

To protect this valuable food source, packs of Otterhounds were kept by country squires and even kings. As a sport, otter hunting was never as popular as the British gentry’s cherished foxhunts, but it did help fill the spring and summer months for sportsmen waiting for the fall hunting season.

Archaeological evidence suggests that IGs were bred as noble companions some 2,000 years ago in the region that is now Greece and Turkey, when the mighty Roman Empire held sway in the Mediterranean.The miniature Greyhound was a popular companion, and perhaps a small-game hunter, throughout southern Europe in the days of the Empire, but the breed came into its own in Renaissance Italy, where owning miniature versions of popular breeds was a status symbol among aristocrats and wealthy strivers. IGs can be seen in the paintings of various Renaissance masters, embodying the grace and balance so important to the era’s aesthetics. IGs found their way onto many of the noblest laps in Europe. James I, Frederick the Great, Catherine the Great, Anne of Denmark, and Queen Victoria were among the royals who augmented their majesty with an IG or two by their side. An African king named Lobengula once swapped 200 head of cattle for a single Italian Greyhound.The AKC registered its first IG in 1886. The depredations of the two world wars nearly wiped out many of Europe’s breeds, including the IG. After both conflicts, American breeders, an ocean away from the ravages of war, kept the breed alive and helped repopulate its numbers in peacetime Europe.

Old-time German farmers bred the Standard down to miniature size, the better to work as fearless barnyard ratters.With his rat-dog background, the Miniature Schnauzer resides in the AKC Terrier Group with other diminutive rat-catcher breeds. But the Mini is unique among AKC terriers in that he has no British blood in his veins. The vast majority of the terrier breeds were developed in the British Isles. The few created outside of Britain—the Rat Terrier or the Cesky Terrier, for instance—were created with crosses to existing British breeds.Alone among terriers, the Miniature Schnauzer is wholly a product of Continental stock: Standard Schnauzer, Affenpinscher, and Poodle. This explains that though the Mini was born to the traditional work of small terriers, his personality is quite different. Not for him is the dour independence of the Scottish Terrier or the fiery temperament of the Irish Terrier. Rather, he is an overtly friendly dog, spirited but obedient and willing to please.For the most part, the Miniature Schnauzer’s ratting days are long behind him. Today, he is best known as a charming and attractive companion, and a steady winner at dog shows here and abroad. Of the three Schnauzer breeds, the Miniature ranks consistently highest in AKC registrations.","Black,Black & Silver,Salt & Pepper"
pomeranian,Pomeranian,6-7 inches,3-7 pounds,12-16 years,Spitz and primitive types,Germany,"The Pomeranian is a miniaturized relation of the powerful spitz-type sled dogs of the Arctic. The breed is named for Pomerania, the area of northeastern Europe that is now part of Poland and western Germany. It was there, hundreds of years ago, that the Pom’s ancestors were bred down from their much bigger, burlier cousins.The Pom, also known as the Zwergspitz in some countries, is the smallest of the spitz breeds. With their elegant appearance and regal bearing, you might say Poms are “fit for a queen”—and you’d be right. The Pom’s popularity is largely due to Queen Victoria, who became smitten with the breed while visiting Florence, Italy. When the dog-happy Dowager Queen returned to Britain with Poms in tow, the breed’s fame was assured.Victoria became a serious breeder and exhibitor of Poms. At the 1891 Crufts dog show, Victoria showed six of her breeding. One of her favorites, Windsor Marco, won first place in the breed. (A British historian wrote, “It would have been a brave judge to have placed her second.”) Victoria is credited for reducing the Pom’s size from about 30 pounds to their current toy stature. It was reported that as the aged queen lay dying in 1901, her favorite Pom, Turi, kept vigil at the foot of her bed.Other historical figures of refined sensibilities who were Pom owners include Marie Antoinette, Emile Zola, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.","Beaver,Black,Black & Tan,Blue,Blue & Tan,Chocolate,Chocolate & Tan,Cream,Orange,Red,Tri-Colored,White,Black & Brindle,Brindle,Mask,Parti-Color,Sable"
border_terrier,Border Terrier,12-15 inches,"13-15.5 pounds (male), 11.5-14 pounds (female)",12-15 years,Terriers,great britain,"In the hilly countryside near the Scottish-English border, old-time farmers and shepherds developed quick, agile terriers to help pursue and dispatch a clever, sheep-stealing predator: the large, powerful hill fox. This required game terriers with legs long enough to run with foxhounds and huntsmen on horseback. But they also had to be small enough to dig into the fox’s lair and force it into the open.These dogs, the ancestors of today’s Border Terrier, were energetic, strong, and tireless, with a wiry, weatherproof coat to protect them from the rain, mist, and notoriously tough terrain of the borderland. Here, a breed historian describes the Border’s working ability: “There is no wall he cannot get over or wire entanglement he cannot scramble through. Should the fox run to earth, he will bolt him every time, or stay the night in the earth until the matter is settled.”Early breed names included the Reedwater Terrier, Ullswater Terrier, and Coquetdale Terrier, all derived from place names in the north of England where these rugged little dogs plied their trade. It was, however, in Northumberland, England’s northernmost county, where the breed earned its enduring reputation as a foxhunter adept at working in tandem with hounds. (And to this day, the Border is known as a terrier who gets on well with his fellow canines.) Foxhunting with Border Terriers in the north country was distinctly different from the pageantry of traditional British foxhunts staged on lavish country estates, where well-heeled horsemen in red coats and high hats rode with huge packs of foxhounds just for the sport of it.Borderland foxhunts were working-class affairs with a practical purpose: to protect shepherds’ flocks from predators. And to this day, the Border Terrier remains a popular option for just plain folks in the United Kingdom looking for a spirited, low-maintenance companion.The Kennel Club (England) recognized the Border Terrier in 1920, and the AKC followed suit 10 years later.","Blue & Tan,Grizzle & Tan,Red,Wheaten,Black & Red,Black & Tan,Grizzle,Red Grizzle & Tan"
airedale,Airedale,23 inches,50-70 pounds,11-14 years,Terriers,great britain,"One of Britain’s key manufacturing centers before the turn of the 20th century, the Aire Valley lies in the north of England, less than a hundred miles from the Scottish border. In the mid-1800s, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, the valley’s factory hands and mill workers first bred tough, devil-may-care Airedales in their own image. (It’s a neat irony that the King of Terriers was developed not by royals but by workingmen.) Airedales were created to be large and fearless hunters of ducks and rats, and no doubt did some poaching on the side. Fittingly for a dog from a manufacturing community, this was a “manufactured” breed: Several existing breeds went into its makeup. These include the Otterhound and such now-extinct breeds as the English Black and Tan Terrier. A practiced eye can also spot traces of the Irish Terrier and Bedlington Terrier in the Airedale. It’s quite possible that setters, retrievers, and herding dogs also played a part in the development of the breed. Airedales served in the British Armed Forces with distinction during the First World War as messengers, sentries, and guard dogs. In North America, the breed was known as a three-in-one hunting dog, equally adept on waterfowl, upland gamebirds, and furred prey. This will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever owned an Airedale, as the breed’s versatility is legendary. Ratter, duck dog, big-game hunter, herder, guardian, warrior, actor, athlete, K-9 cop, and babysitter are all jobs held at various times by the mighty King of Terriers.","Black & Tan,Grizzle & Tan"
chihuahua,Chihuahua,5-8 inches,not exceeding 6 pounds,14-16 years,Companion and Toy Dogs,mexico,"Likenesses of Chihuahua-like dogs decorate the artifacts of lost civilizations around the world. Trading among ancient cultures was more widespread than commonly assumed, so it is no surprise that similar dog types took root in far-flung places. How the Chihuahua type first came to the peoples of Mexico, however, is a secret of prehistory. We do know that when the Toltecs held sway in Mexico about a thousand years ago, their breed of choice was the Techichi, a larger, heavier ancestor of today’s Chi.The Aztecs conquered the Toltecs in the 12th century. Historians credit the Aztecs with refining the Techichi into a smaller, lighter dog. By the time Spanish conquistadors toppled Aztec civilization in the 1500s, the Techichi was so integral to Aztec culture it was considered one of Montezuma’s fabled treasures, once presumed lost forever after the conquest of Cortez.But the hardy little dogs lived on in remote villages and, in the mid-1800s, when Americans began to take an interest in the breed, they found many specimens in the State of Chihuahua. So it was that this survivor of two lost civilizations gained worldwide fame as the Chihuahua. The first AKC-registered Chihuahua, a little guy named Beppie, was recorded in 1908.The famous bandleader Xavier Cugat did much to popularize Chihuahuas in the 1940s and 50s. More recently, these natural performers stole the show in “Beverly Hills Chihuahua,” “Legally Blonde,” and “Sex and the City.” The minor-league baseball team of El Paso, Texas, is named the Chihuahuas.","Black,Black & Tan,Blue & Tan,Chocolate,Chocolate & Tan,Cream,Fawn,Fawn & White,Red,Black & Red,Black & Silver,Black & White,Blue,Blue & White,Chocolate & White,Cream & White,Gold,Gold & White,Red & White,Silver,Silver & White,White"

chesapeake_bay_retriever,Chesapeake Bay Retriever,"23-26 inches (male), 21-24 inches (female)","65-80 pounds (male), 55-70 pounds (female)",10-13 years,Retrievers,united states of america,"Wealthy owners of duck clubs that lined both shores of the Chesapeake Bay during the 19th century set the basic breed type of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever. Newfoundlands, Irish Water Spaniels, and hounds of undetermined origin were among the dogs thought to be in the genetic mix. By the time the AKC was founded in 1884, a definite Chessie type had been established. (Colorful regional breed names for the era’s Chessie included the Red Chester and the Brown Winchester.)To understand the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, you must understand the Chesapeake Bay. For this purpose, there are two key features of this 200-mile-long estuary surrounded by Maryland and Virginia. First, because the bay is relatively shallow, it has a low capacity for storing heat; water temperatures get down around freezing in early winter and stay there until spring.Second, the Chesapeake Bay is located along what’s called the Atlantic Flyway, a flight path taken by ducks and geese to their winter homes. Every year, the bay hosts a third of all migratory waterfowl wintering on the East Coast.Old-time sportsmen hoping to exploit this duck hunter’s paradise built a retriever well-suited to the bay’s frigid waters. The thick, oily, double coat of the Chessie is both insulating and waterproof; it repels moisture much the way a duck’s feathers do. His broad chest acts as a plow against the ice floes and powerful hindquarters and large webbed feet enable him to swim tirelessly against the slashing winds that whip across the bay. Ideally equipped to perform their primary function, it has been reported that some Chessies are capable of retrieving 300 ducks in a single day. Whether this is true or simply the fireside boasting of hunters, it does convey an essential truth: The Chessie is a reliable, indefatigable retriever.Happily, the Chessie isn’t a one-trick dog. These perceptive and sensitive souls make excellent therapy workers. Their sturdy build and acute scenting ability are highly valued by K-9 handlers in the fields of search-and-rescue work and drug and bomb detection. And their dashing good looks and athleticism are employed to great advantage in show rings and in a variety of dog sports.","Brown,Deadgrass,Sedge,Tan"

norwich_terrier,Norwich Terrier,10 inches,12 pounds,12-15 years,Terriers,great britain,"The Norwich Terrier is among the seemingly endless variety of terriers bred to control Britain’s rodent population. In addition to being ratters, Norwiches were used in packs on foxhunts, and so were bred to be more sociable than the usual independent-minded terrier.The Norwich is famously associated with Cambridge University, where, in the 1870s and ’80s, Norwich ownership became a fad among undergraduates. The students acquired the dogs as pets and dorm-room ratters from a livery stable on nearby Trumpington Street, and the breed became known as Trumpington Terriers. One of these dogs, named Rags, came into the possession of a stableyard owner in the town of Norwich. Rags was bred, sired several litters of admirable quality, as is today considered the granddaddy of today’s Norwich.The breed’s American history began in 1914, when a Brit named Frank “Roughrider” Jones utilized descendents of Rags to breed a dog named Willum. Willum was exported to Philadelphia, where he became the breed’s cornerstone sire in the United States. So closely was Roughrider Jones associated with these cheerful, prick-eared terriers that the breed came to be known among American fanciers as the Jones Terrier. Long after the breed was recognized by the English and American kennel clubs in the1930s as the Norwich Terrier, American breed devotees referred to their charming little dogs as Jones Terriers.Norwich and Norfolk terriers are so closely related that the AKC did not recognize them as separate breeds until 1979. Perhaps the Norwich with the highest pop-culture profile of recent times was Winky, from the movie “Best in Show,” who was played by a real-life show champion.","Black & Tan,Grizzle,Red,Wheaton"
french_bulldog,French Bulldog,11-13 inches,under 28 pounds,10-12 years,Companion and Toy Dogs,france,"In the mid-1800s, a toy-size Bulldog found favor in some English cities, including Nottingham, then a center for lace making. The toy Bulldog became something of a mascot for Nottingham’s lace makers. This was the height of the Industrial Revolution in England, and such “cottage industries” as lace making were increasingly threatened. Many in the lace trade relocated to northern France, and of course, they brought their toy Bulldogs with them.The little dogs became popular in the French countryside where lace makers settled. Over a span of decades, the toy Bulldogs were crossed with other breeds, perhaps terriers and  Pugs, and, along the way, developed their now-famous bat ears. They were given the name Bouledogue Français.Paris eventually discovered the delightful new breed, and thus began the Frenchie’s reputation as city dog par excellence. The breed came to be associated with Paris café life, and with the bon vivants and fancy ladies who sought nocturnal pleasures in Parisian dancehalls. Edgar Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec depicted the Frenchie in paintings of the Paris demimonde.By the end of the 19th century, the Frenchie’s popularity had spread across Europe and to America. The breed was tougher sell in England. The Bulldog was a national symbol, and it rankled many Englishmen that their age-old rivals, the French, would dare adapt it to their purposes.American devotees of the early 1900s contributed to the breed by insisting that the bat ear, as opposed to the “rose ear,” was the correct Frenchie type. It is by this distinctive feature that the Frenchie is instantly recognizable the world over.","Brindle,Brindle & White,Cream,Fawn,Fawn & White,White,White & Brindle,White & Fawn,Cream & White,Fawn Brindle & White,Ticked,Piebald"

Imperial breeders in the palace of the Chinese emperor developed the Shih Tzu (meaning “lion dog”) centuries ago from Tibetan breeding stock. The breed is most likely the product of crosses of two even older Sino-Tibetan breeds, the Lhaso Apso and the Pekingese.For hundreds of years, Shih Tzu lived the life of royal lap warmers and were pampered by emperors and their families. It is said emperors would give valuable gifts to breeders of Shih Tzu who produced the most beautiful and affectionate dogs.The breed remained hidden behind palace walls, virtually unknown to the outside world, until the1930s. Breed clubs formed in Peking and later England further refined the breed, not without much debate among fanciers as to proper type. The Shih Tzu entered the AKC Stud Book in 1969.Since then, the Shih Tzu has been one of the most popular toy dogs here and in the United Kingdom. And they still treat their owners, no matter who they might be, like royalty.

To move and guard their herds in the days before industrial agriculture, Swiss cattlemen developed four breeds of Alpine mountain dogs known for their beautiful tricolor coats. Of these, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is the largest, and the Entlebucher Mountain Dog the smallest and quickest.The name Entlebucher, “Entle” for short, derives from the place of the breed’s origin, the valley of the river Entlebuch. They were employed as all-around farm dogs and guarders, but the primary task of these clever cattle dogs was to drive their charges up to high mountain pastures in the summer, keep an eye on the herd during grazing season, then move them back down into the valley for the winter.This job description explains several of the Entle’s key traits. Bred to move cattle up and down sloping pastures, Entles developed remarkable balance and agility. The long, low Entle physique isn’t as exaggerated as a Pembroke Welsh Corgi’s, but the idea is the same: It makes it easier to nip at a cow’s heels and to avoid being kicked.The breed’s love of work, and life in general, earned it the nickname “der Lachen Hunden” (the Laughing Dog). So enthusiastic is the working Entle, he might leap up and slam into a stubborn cow to move it. Such a can-do work ethic is essential in a 60-pound dog charged with moving a herd of 1,500-pound animals up the side of a mountain.","Black,Black White & Tan"

They bred dogs for hard work in the coldest habitable places on earth. In the Siberian town of Oymyakon, for instance, temperatures of minus-60 degrees are common. The Samoyede people lived in tents and huddled for warmth with their dog packs during the Arctic nights. This type of human-canine cooperation for mutual survival forged a tight bond between Samoyeds and people. When not sledging heavy loads across vast expanses of Siberia, Samoyed dogs earned their feed as watchdogs and hunters.The Samoyede depended on reindeer as a vital source of food, fur, and leather. At first, they used their dogs to hunt reindeer. But in time Samoyede culture shifted from hunting reindeer to herding them. The bold white hunting dogs and haulers found a new role as stock dogs, moving and protecting the herds.In the late 18th century, Arctic adventurers returning to England introduced the Samoyed to British dog lovers of refined tastes. Queen Alexandria was an admirer who did much to promote the breed as a companion and show dog. In America, a sparkling white dog named Moustan of Argenteau made history in 1906 as the first of the breed (then known as the Samoyede) registered by the AKC. American and European mushers of the early 20th century knew the Samoyed as an enthusiastic hauler of supplies, capable of sledging one and a half times their own weight.

These brutal marauders rampaged across the continent on horseback, leaving in their wake a wide swath of death and destruction. They ranged as far west as Paris and as far south as the toe of Italy, before settling in what is now Hungary.The supremacy of Magyar cavalry was predicated on three qualities: speed, agility, and toughness. Accordingly, Magyar warriors carefully bred these qualities into their horses—and their dogs. In this lightning-fast kingdom on horseback, it was either keep up or perish. The Magyars’ nimble red dogs, ancestors of the modern Vizsla, kept up.Over centuries, Hungarian nobles and warlords refined these dogs and set the type of the modern Vizsla. The breed became famous as a swift, all-purpose hunting dog who could do just about anything asked. In modern times, that eagerness has won Vizslas generations of American fans.The first Vizsla to come to America, in 1950, was smuggled out of Communist Hungary with the help of a U.S. State Department employee. Fifty years later, a Vizsla named Chartay became the first dog in AKC history to earn championships in five different sports—a quintuple champion.

Spaniels have been bird hunters’ helpers since before the development of the rifle, when hunting dogs were used in tandem with nets.For centuries, European and British spaniels were informally grouped as simply land spaniels and water spaniels. By the 19th century, however, when written breed standards, dog shows and field trials, and the very notion of purebred dogs began to gain traction in England, the various spaniels were classified as specific breeds. Among them was the Cocker, so called because they specialized on woodcock. These dogs, smaller than English Springer Spaniels but larger than English Toy Spaniels, were the ancestors of the modern Cocker Spaniel.In America, the Cocker Spaniel diverged into two varieties, American and English. The English was characterized as being taller and with a longer head than its American cousin, with a coat that was not as profuse. The English and Canadian kennel clubs registered the varieties as separate breeds beginning in 1940, and the AKC followed suit in 1946. The AKC breed names are the Cocker Spaniel (for the U.S. type) and the English Cocker Spaniel (for the British type).A black Cocker named Brucie helped popularize the breed by twice winning Westminster’s Best in Show, in 1940 and ’41, but the Cocker’s American heyday came in the 1950s. The Cocker was the AKC’s most popular breed of the decade.

blenheim_spaniel,Blenheim Spaniel,12-13 inches,13-18 pounds,12-15 years,Companion and Toy Dogs,great britain,"Toy spaniels were the province of European nobility from at least Renaissance times. Two 17th-century British monarchs, the ill-fated King Charles I and his son Charles II, were especially devoted to a black and tan variety of toy spaniel that eventually was named in the latter’s honor. According to the famed diarist of the Restoration era, Samuel Pepys, Charles II seemed more concerned with breeding spaniels than ruling Britain. Toy spaniels remained a great favorite of British aristocrats into the early 19th century. Among their upper-crust partisans of this era was the Marlborough family, who bred a line of red-and-whites at Blenheim Palace. Later in the century, in the age of Victoria, the breed was crossed with Asian toys, probably Pugs and Japanese Chin, and became what is known in America as the English Toy Spaniel (or, in the United Kingdom, the King Charles Spaniel).This new-style toy spaniel had a domed skull and a flatter face than those of Charles’s time. Before long, this type came to dominate, and the traditional toy spaniel of the Restoration was rendered nearly extinct—but not forgotten.Fanciers of the 1920s wondered whether there still existed the old-type toy spaniel immortalized in ancestor portraits hanging in the stately halls of English manors. A wealthy American named Roswell Eldridge offered a cash prize to British breeders who could produce “Bleinheim Spaniels of the Old World type.” The prospect of prize money drove breeders to revive the old style. These dogs were dubbed Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. (The name Cavalier is a nod to the monarchist party that supported the Stuarts during the civil war that cost Charles I his head.)The breed is notable for its four distinct color patterns, each of which, at various times, was associated with a particular noble family: Blenheim (chestnut markings on a white background), Tricolor (black markings on a white background), Black and Tan (black with tan markings), and Ruby (a rich red).","Black & Tan,Black & White,Blenheim,Ruby"

The army required tough, durable dogs to move and guard the herd. Utilizing Asian mastiff types as breeding stock, the Romans developed the distant ancestor of today’s Rottweiler. For centuries the legions struggled to contain Germanic tribes, the so-called barbarian hoards, massed on the Empire’s northern borders. The dogs the Romans brought to these areas became foundation stock for many German breeds.In the centuries after the empire’s collapse, the Roman drover dogs found work in the cattle town of Rottweil. It was here, moving herds from pasture to market and protecting all concerned from bandits and rustlers along the way, that they earned the name Rottweiler Metzgerhund, or Butcher’s Dog of Rottweil.The Rottie’s career in livestock ended with the rise of the railroad cattle cars in the 1800s. They found new work as police dogs, personal protectors, and all-around blue-collar dogs capable of performing various heavy-duty tasks. Rotties were among the first guide dogs for the blind, and in more recent times they distinguished themselves as search-and-rescue workers at such disaster sites as Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center.Considering the many roles the breed has played during its long history, it is remarkable that the Butcher’s Dog has changed little in form and temper since its first German breed standard was drawn up in 1901.","Black & Mahogany,Black & Rust,Black & Tan"
whippet,Whippet,"19-22 inches (male), 18-21 inches (female)",25-40 pounds,12-15 years,Sighthounds,great britain,"For thousands of years the Greyhound has been the template for later sighthounds, and the mild-mannered Whippet is a highly successful member of this clan of lightning-fast sprinters.The Whippet’s story begins in Victorian England. North-country coal miners enjoyed the sports of dog racing and rabbit hunting on their days off. But they couldn’t afford to feed and kennel large athletes like Greyhounds, nor did they have the space to properly exercise them. The miners’ practical solution was to breed a smaller version of the Greyhound. Though it is uncertain which breeds were utilized to create the Whippet, the miners plainly did their work well. Their handiwork, the Whippet, is the fastest breed of its size, reaching speeds of up to 35 miles per hour.In its formative days, the Whippet breed had such colorful nicknames as the “Poor Man’s Racehorse” and the “Lightning Rag Dog” (they would chase a rag dragged along a straight course in an early version of lure coursing). The name Whippet seems to derive from “whappet,” an antique word that means “a small dog that yaps.”By the turn of the 20th century, textile workers from Lancashire were emigrating to New England. Among the touches of home they brought to the New World were their Whippets. The Whippet was an instant success in America, and Whippet racing—for money or just for fun—caught on with people from all walks of life, just as it had in England. The AKC registered its first Whippet in 1888. These days, lure coursing provides an excellent outlet for the Whippet’s need for speed.","Black,Blue,Cream,Fawn,Red,White,White & Black,White & Blue,White & Blue Brindle,White & Blue Fawn,White & Fawn,White & Fawn Brindle,White & Red,White & Red Brindle"

Belgium has long been the world’s leading exporter of milk chocolate, a key component to the national economy. It should, then, come as no surprise that old-time Belgian farmers were preoccupied with cattle herding.This preoccupation included the breeding of herding dogs. In fact, there were once eight types of shepherd dogs unique to Belgium. By the 1890s, when they were officially classified for the first time, there remained the four we know today: The Belgian Sheepdog (aka Groenendael or Chien de Berger Belge), Malinois, Tervuren and Laekenois. They were anatomically identical but varied in coat textures, colors, and length. The name Groenendael was given to the longhaired black variety, today’s Belgian Sheepdog, thanks to Nicolas Rose, an important breeder of the 1890s who operated a restaurant near Brussels called the Chateau Groenendael.By the turn of the 20th century, the versatility and work drive of Belgian Sheepdogs were becoming known beyond the pastures of Belgium. Paris and New York used Belgian Sheepdogs as police dogs in this era. Customs agent employed them on border patrols, rooting out smugglers. During World War I, they distinguished themselves as messengers, ambulance dogs, and freighters of heavy gunnery. Belgian Sheepdogs reprised their role as war dogs during the Second World War.The Belgian Sheepdog Club of America was formed in 1949, and since then this noble breed has done it all: show dog, athlete, police officer, soldier, service dog, searcher and rescuer, watchdog, and tireless backyard tennis-ball fetcher.","Black,Black & White,Black & Cream,Brown,Fawn,Fawn & Black,Gray,Gray & Black,Sable,Silver,Silver & Black,Wolfgray & Black,Spotted"

Belgium once had several “bouvier” breeds; the Bouvier des Flandres is the last to exist in any great numbers.In medieval times, when the Bouvier was first conceived, Flanders was a principality encompassing parts of modern-day France, Belgium, and The Netherlands. (To this day, both France and Belgium claim the Bouvier as a native breed.) As the breed’s many early names suggest, moving cattle was the Bouvier’s primary occupation. But the thrifty farmers of France and the Low Countries preferred owning one versatile dog instead of a team of specialists, so Bouviers earned their keep as herders, watchdogs, guardians, and cart-pullers.By the turn of the 20th century, Bouviers were attracting the attention of international dog fanciers far from the farms and pastures of Flanders. A Belgian breed club was formed, and French and Belgian experts drew up a written standard. With the outbreak of World War I, however, the Bouvier’s bucolic homeland became a nightmarish battlefield. The region’s farmers were displaced, and their dogs lost or destroyed.The Belgian army was responsible for keeping the breed alive, and Bouviers distinguished themselves as courageous and resourceful dogs of war. In peacetime, Bouviers burnished their résumé as European police K-9s and guide dogs for the blind.After the second world war the Bouvier was again nearly extinct, but European expatriates kept the breed alive in America.

australian_terrier,Australian Terrier,10-11 inches,15-20 pounds,11-15 years,Terriers,australia,"Among the touches of home that 19th century British settlers brought to Australia were several breeds of working terrier. The Aussie is said to be the result of interbreeding such British mainstays as the Cairn, Dandie Dinmont, Norwich, Scottie, Skye, and Yorkshire terriers—and a practiced eye can spot aspects of these and other terriers in the Aussie makeup. Aussies were bred to be fearless, all-purpose exterminators, working on small mammals and snakes. (A breed historian says that the Aussie employed a “leap-twist-and-pounce” approach to snake killing.)Life in the remote regions of Australia with little company forged a tight bond between Aussies and their people. These tough little frontier dogs, among the smallest of the working terriers, proved to be cuddly, eternally devoted pets when the day’s work was done.To this day, outgoing Aussies are people-oriented companions who don’t do well when neglected—they practically demand to be part of the family.The Australian Terrier can make a fair claim to being “Australia’s Dog.” It was the first native breed to be officially recognized in its homeland, and the first Australian breed to be recognized in other countries. The first club devoted to the breed was founded in Melbourne in 1887, a breed standard was devised, and imports to America and Britain began soon after. The Kennel Club (England) granted the Aussie breed status in 1933, and the AKC recognized the breed in 1960.","Blue & Tan,Red,Sandy,Black,Black & Red,Black & Tan,Blue,Blue & Black,Blue Black & Tan,Brindle,Red & Black,Red & Tan,Red & White,Sable"

Coonhounds are often portrayed in pop culture as lazy ol’ dawgs snoozing away their lives on the front porch.

Because the dog was built so low and the cover was so high, Sussex developed a language of barks and babbling to mark their location to human huntsmen. And to this day, Sussex tend to be more vocal than other spaniels.",Golden liver

It is thought that the friars of the Abbey of St. Hubert were responsible for crossing strains of older French breeds to create a low-built scenting hound that could plod over rough terrain while followed on foot by a human hunting partner tracking rabbit and deer. Their accuracy and persistence on scent made Bassets a popular choice for French aristocrats, for whom hunting was a way of life.","Black & White,Black Brown & White,Black Tan & White,Black White & Brown,Black White & Tan,Brown Black & White,Lemon & White,Mahogany & White,Red & White,Black & Brown,Black Red & White,Blue & White,Blue Tan & White,Brown & White,Tan & White,White & Lemon,White & Red,White Black & Brown,White Black & Red,Ticked"

There is, however, no such breed as the “French Poodle.” In France, Poodles are known as the Caniche, or “duck dog.”Despite the Poodle’s association with France, the breed originated as a duck hunter in Germany, where the word “pudelin” refers to splashing in water. The Standard Poodle began its development as a retrieving water dog more than 400 years ago. With a crisp, curly coat as protection against the elements, superlative swimming ability, and off-the-charts intelligence, the Poodle was, and still is, a magnificent retriever. (The Standard is the only breed classified as a non-sporting dog that is eligible for AKC Retriever Hunting Tests).The flamboyant Poodle show coat served a practical purpose in the breed’s early years. Hunters wanted their dogs to have free range of movement in the water, but they also wished to protect vital areas of the anatomy from the cold. They shaved the legs, neck, and tail but left the chest, hips, and leg joints coated. The rounded tufts on the legs, hips, and tail tip are called pompons. (Note the spelling: Cheerleaders have pom-poms; Poodles have pompons.)The Poodle’s many fine qualities allowed it to move from the lake to the lap of luxury. Elegant Poodles of the Standard and Miniature varieties found favor among the nobles of France and, eventually, all of Europe. The breed’s showy looks and trainability made it a natural entertainer, and Poodles have long been associated with the European circus tradition. An excellent nose brought the Poodle additional work as a truffle hunter.The Standard was bred down to the Miniature. The Toy was first bred in America, in the early 20th century, as a city-dwelling companion dog. Well-bred specimens of each variety are exact replicas of each other and are bred to the same standard.","Apricot,Black,Blue,Brown,Cream,Gray,Red,Silver,White,Black & Apricot,Black & Brown,Black & Cream,Black & Gray,Black & Red,Black & Silver,Black & Tan,Black & White,Blue & White,Brown & Apricot,Brown & White,Cream & White,Gray & White,Red & Apricot,Red & White,White & Apricot,White & Silver"
flat-coated_retriever,Flat-Coated Retriever,"23-24.5 inches (male), 22-23.5 inches (female)",60-70 pounds,8-10 years,Retrievers,great britain,"Flat-Coats are one of six AKC retriever breeds: tireless, trainable lake hunters who retrieve downed waterfowl. Retrievers mark where a duck falls and, on command, swim a straight path to the game, grip it gently in their mouth, swim a straight path back to the hunter, and deliver the prize to hand. In the park or backyard, a retriever’s hunting traits are expressed in seemingly endless games of fetch, an affinity for water, and an eagerness to work closely with an adored human.Flat-Coats were first bred in the mid-1800s, a relatively recent development in the AKC universe, where many breeds go back to antiquity. Flat-Coats were once Britain’s most popular retriever, before being overtaken by Labs and Goldens, and was once called the “Gamekeeper’s Dog” because of its widespread use on the sprawling estates of the English gentry.Among the component breeds in the Flat-Coat’s genetic background are the St. John’s Dog (an early version of the Lab) and various setter types. From the beginning, the coat was a striking aspect of the breed. Alternate breed names have included the Wavy-Coated Retriever, the Black Wavy Retriever, and Smooth-Coated Retriever, all referring to the breed’s unique beauty. Aside from its good looks, the coat is highly functional: it protects these superb retrievers from harsh weather, icy water, and punishing ground cover.","Black,Liver,Yellow"
chow,Chow,17-20 inches,45-70 pounds,8-12 years,Spitz and primitive types,china,"The Chow Chow, among the world’s most singular and possibly oldest breeds, is depicted in artifacts of China’s Han Dynasty (c. 206 b.c.), but evidence suggests Chows go back much further and are progenitors of other spitz-type breeds—from the burly Norwegian Elkhound to the dainty Pomeranian.Chows have played many roles during their long history. At times, they were the lordly companions to Chinese nobles. An emperor of the Tang Dynasty, circa eighth century, was said to have owned a kennel facility that housed some 5,000 Chows and a permanent staff of twice that number. But over the centuries they also earned their keep as guarders, haulers, and hunters. Their ancestors were even a food source in the distant past of their densely populated, protein-starved homeland. An ancient breed nickname is the Edible Dog, and a theory behind the origin of the name Chow maintains that it derives from the Cantonese word for “edible.”A more popular explanation of the breed name concerns 18th-century trading ships of the British Empire. At that time, the pidgin-English expression “chow chow” described the small, miscellaneous items within a ship’s cargo that weren’t itemized. “Chow chow” was simply another way of saying “etcetera,” and the odd-looking dogs British traders acquired in China were included on the ship’s manifest under the catchall “chow chow.”In the 1820s Chow Chows were exhibited at the London Zoo as the “Wild Dogs of China,” but they didn’t really catch on in the West until Queen Victoria, an inveterate dog lover, acquired one later in the century. Chows were first exhibited in America in the 1890s and were admitted to the AKC in 1903.","Black,Blue,Cinnamon,Cream,Red"
basenji,Basenji,"17 inches (male), 16 inches (female)","24 pounds (male), 22 pounds (female)",13-14 years,Spitz and primitive types,central africa,"Basenjis are contenders for the title of oldest AKC breed. Paleontologists tell us that the first domesticated dogs looked a lot like Basenjis. They were already well established when they were brought up the Nile from interior Africa as gifts for the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Basenjis are depicted in ancient Egyptian artifacts, and traces of the breed can also be seen in ancient Babylonian and Mesopotamian art.These once-mighty civilizations collapsed millennia ago, but the Basenji endured as a semi-wild dog living at the headwaters of both the Nile and Congo rivers. African tribesmen prized Basenjis as versatile hunters with keen eyesight, explosive speed, and a highly developed sense of smell. Basenjis are known expert vertical leapers, a skill developed to scout prey in African grasslands. (An African breed name translates as “the jumping-up-and-down dog.”) Father Jerome Merolla, a 17th-century Catholic missionary to the Congo, left behind this written description of the Basenjis he saw living a feral state: “These dogs, notwithstanding their wildness, do little or no damage to the inhabitants. They are red-haired, have small slender bodies and their tails turned upon their backs.”Isolated in remote areas of the African continent for thousands of years, the unique Basenji went unaltered by Western fads and fancies. The breed that so impressed the pharaohs was pretty much the same as the breed that was introduced to the West in the late 1800s.A breeding pair was brought to England by a returning explorer in 1895, but they died soon thereafter. Another pair was brought to England in 1937. They were exhibited as natural curiosities, and this previously unknown breed caused such a sensation with the dog-loving British public that police were called in for crowd control. But, again, tragedy struck: The female and a litter of puppies died, leaving only the male, named Bois. Bois was acquired by a Boston breeder who had recently obtained a female named Congo. This resulted in the first Basenjis bred in America. More dogs were slowly added to the gene pool until, finally, the Basenji was established in the United States.","Black & White,Black Tan & White,Brindle & White,Red & White,Black Brindle & White,Blue Cream & White,Cream & White,Mahogany & White,Sable & White"

They were expected to fight one another, or they were turned loose in packs against a staked bear or bull, with spectators betting on the grisly outcome. Such revolting pastimes have long since been outlawed. These sad spectacles did, however, leave us a happy legacy: Several of today’s most loved breeds—the Bulldog, the Bull Terrier, and the American Staffordshire Terrier among them—got their start as fighting and baiting dogs of the 18th and 19th centuries.When it comes to the bull-type terrier breeds, all can agree that the common component in their makeup was the Bulldog. (Note that the Bulldog of 200 years ago was a vastly different, more ferocious creature than the lovable “sourmugs” of today.) Argument begins when breed experts try to nail down which preexisting terrier breeds reside in the AmStaff’s genetic background. Some suggest that such extinct breeds as the White English Terrier and Black-and-Tan Terrier were part of the genetic mix that led to the creation of the Staffordshire Terrier, forerunner of the AmStaff.Whatever the AmStaff’s true genetic composition might be, we are certain that working-class Brits with an interest in blood sports combined the stocky build and punishing jaws of old-style Bulldogs with the innate courage and “gameness” of terriers to create bull-type terrier breeds.By the mid-1800s, Staffordshire Terriers had arrived in America. U.S. breeders developed a Staffordshire Terrier that was larger than the English version. Eventually, the AKC recognized the two types as separate breeds: the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier.The well-bred AmStaff of today is a more mellow fellow than his pit-fighting ancestors and has long been a great American favorite. This is suggested by the breed’s many sightings in our popular culture: In 1903, an AmStaff named Bud was along for the ride on America’s first cross-country auto trip (the subject of the Ken Burns documentary “Horatio’s Drive”); Petey, in the old “Our Gang” film comedies of the 1930s, was an AmStaff, as is Tige, the dog in the Buster Brown Shoes logo; and America’s most decorated American war dog was an AmStaff named Sgt. Stubby, a K-9 of World War I who counted three U.S. presidents among his admirers.","Black,Blue,Bronze,Fawn,Liver,Red,White,Patched,Spotted"

Pushed by breed promoter, Max Siber, the Appenzeller was designated a breed of its own by the Swiss Cynological Society in 1898.Initiated by Professor Dr. Albert Heim, a committed fancier of Swiss Cattle Dogs, the Appenzeller Sennenhund Club was established in 1906 to promote and preserve the breed. Dr. Heim set up the first valid breed standard in 1914 and with that the compulsory registration of puppies in the Appenzeller Dog Stud Book.Today, the breed can be seen all over Switzerland and in other parts of Europe. Though considered rare, numbers of Appenzellers are slowly increasing in North America as well. The breeding stock is still very small, and it is only by careful and responsible breeding that it will be possible to establish and consolidate its natural and outstanding hereditary qualities.","black, tan and white"
staffordshire_bullterrier,Staffordshire Bullterrier,14-16 inches,"28-38 pounds (male), 24-34 pounds (female)",12-14 years,Terriers,great britain,"The story of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a relatively brief one in the grand scheme of canine history, but it can be confused by the several different names hung on the breed at various times. The Bull-and-Terrier, the Patched Fighting Terrier, the Staffordshire Pit-dog, and the Brindle Bull are a few of the Stafford’s historical aliases.Staffordshire Bull Terriers are among the AKC terriers, such as the Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier, classified as “bull types.” All have a similar backstory. A few centuries ago, in the days when betting on the outcome of dog-oriented blood sports was all the rage in England, gamblers bred ferocious dogs to excel in these ghastly affairs. The granddaddy of these breeds was the Bulldog, created for the horrifying spectacle of bull-baiting.Blood sports were outlawed in 1835, but pit-dog wagering continued as an underground activity. In these illicit pits, usually housed in a cellar, away from the prying eyes of the law, dogs would either do battle against one another, gladiator-style, or would be set against a sack full of rats. Gamblers took Bulldogs, unemployed after bull-baiting went by the boards, and crossed them with quick, feisty terriers. The results were fighting dogs with the punishing jaws of a Bulldog and the fiery spirit of a terrier.From among the profusion of breeds created in this way, most now extinct, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, perfected by one James Hinks, of Birmingham, England, in the mid-19th century, emerged as one of the most successful and enduring. The breed name that finally came to these burly, broad-skulled terriers is a nod to the county of Staffordshire, where the breed was especially popular.After the Staffordshire Bull arrived in North America in the 1880s, breeders developed a taller, heavier offshoot, the American Staffordshire Terrier, or AmStaff. Since then, more than a hundred years of responsible breeding has transformed both breeds from brawlers to trustworthy family companions.","Black,Black & White,Blue,Blue & White,Brindle,Brindle & White,Fawn,Fawn & White,Red,Red & White,White,White & Brindle,White & Fawn,White & Red,Black & Tan,Liver"

irish_setter,Irish Setter,"27 inches (male), 25 inches (female)","70 pounds (male), 60 pounds (female)",12-15 years,Pointing Dogs,ireland,"A setter is a type of dog bred to locate gamebirds by using their keen sense of smell. The setter shows a hunter he’s found birds by “setting” down on his belly. Before the invention of firearms, setters worked in tandem with trained falcons and hunters using nets. Today, setters are gundogs, that is, they work with a hunter toting a rifle.Irish huntsmen of the 1800s bred their sleek, rangy “Red Setters” to move freely and swiftly, the better to cover ground in the wide, flat countryside of the Emerald Isle. By way of contrast, the Irish Setter’s kinsman from Scotland, the Gordon Setter, was built to flush and retrieve game on rocky, punishing terrain and is therefore a heavier-bodied dog that moves at a more deliberate pace.The Irish Setter earned a reputation as an energetic but efficient worker in the bird fields, and, thanks to its eye-catching good looks and graceful gait, has been a big winner in the show ring since the sport’s beginnings in the 1870s. Eleven Irish have won the Sporting Group competition at the Westminster Kennel Club show over the years. The most famous Irish Setter of all time, however, was fictional, the title character of Jim Kjelgaard’s 1945 novel “Big Red.” President Richard Nixon’s Irish Setter, King Timahoe, was named for a small town in Ireland that was the homeland of the president’s ancestors.","Chestnut,Mahogany,Red"

The infusion of native Khoi blood gave resulting generations a resiliency against local pests such as the tsetse fly, as well as an inborn knowledge of how to navigate their new African environs – and outwit its deadly predators.In the late 19th Century, Rhodesian big-game hunter Cornelius van Rooyen incorporated two ridged Greyhound-like females into his pack of lion dogs. He found that their ridged offspring excelled at confronting and confounding the king of beasts, giving the hunter time to sight in his rifle and dispatch his prey. These ridged dogs were also successful at fending off other dangerous animals such as leopards and baboons, trotting effortlessly alongside horse-mounted riders all day, breaking off to course quick-footed game such as antelope to provide meat for the pot, and protecting the homestead from all intruders. They were known then, as they are today, for their devotion to family, and tolerance and affection for its children.In 1922, a meeting was convened to write the first Rhodesian Ridgeback standard. By then, big-game hunting had already begun to fade in South Africa, and the breed itself was on the brink of extinction. The dogs convened at this meeting ranged in size and appearance from Bull Terriers to Great Dane, and the Dalmatian standard was used as a template to arrive at the standardized vision of the breed that we know today. ",Wheaten

The key figure of the Weimaraner’s early history was Germany’s Grand Duke Karl August, who held court in the town of Weimar. The duke, like so many European nobles of the age, was an avid sportsman. His dream was to develop the perfect hunting dog. In pursuit of this ambition, he is said to have crossed Bloodhounds with various German and French hunting dogs. The result was the Weimar Pointer, or Weimaraner.The duke and his fellow noblemen at first used these unique-looking dogs as big-game hunters, in pursuit of bears, mountain lions, and wolves. As Europe’s population of these predators decreased, the Weimaraner found new work as an all-purpose hunter who points and retrieves gamebirds.The Weimaraner was a jealously guarded secret for many years among the German aristocracy, but good specimens began arriving in America by the late 1920s. The breed’s U.S. popularity as a pet and hunting dog took off in the 1950s, with such celebrity owners as President Eisenhower and movie star Grace Kelly. The breed received another boost from photographer and artist William Wegman, who became world famous for his Weimaraner portraits.","Blue,Gray"

German farmers who sought opportunity in America brought their Old World ways to such states as Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ohio—and the German influence can still be felt in the upper Midwest to this day. Lutheranism, the brewing industry, and the region’s mania for German-style foods are cultural touchstones these immigrants transplanted to their corner of the New World. Another was a Nordic breed called the German Spitz, used as all-around farm dogs. These little white dogs were ancestors of the modern Eskie. By the latter years of the 19th century, it was becoming difficult to keep these beautiful, highly-trainable dogs down on the farm. Show business was beckoning.Back when traveling circuses, vaudeville troupes, and Wild West shows crisscrossed pre-electronic America, German Spitz—thanks to their intelligence, agility, and showy looks—became mainstays of trained-dog acts. (This held true well into the 20th century. Perhaps America’s most famous performing dog of the 1930s was Pierre, an Eskie tightrope walker with the Barnum & Bailey Circus.)Upon America’s entry into World War I in 1917, the country was gripped by a prejudice against all things Teutonic. The breed’s German name was changed to “American Eskimo” Dog, after the name used by a spitz breeding kennel in Ohio. Though the breed has a long and fascinating U.S. history, it was not until 1995 that the AKC registered its first American Eskimo Dog.The little white wonder dogs who performed various chores around Midwestern farms, and later charmed audiences under the circus big top, are today sought out by pet owners looking for versatile, fun-loving companions.","White,White & Biscuit"
briard,Briard,"23-27 inches (male), 22-25.5 inches (female)",55-100 pounds,12 years,Sheepdogs and Cattledogs (except Swiss Cattledogs),france,"In the dairy belt of northern France, the Briard, or Chien Berger de Brie as the breed is known in his homeland, has been working pastures since the time of Charlemagne. The breed is named for the dairy-producing region of Brie, best known for the gooey cheese of the same name.French farmers, known for frugality, developed Briards as two-in-one dogs: They are sheepherders famed for quicksilver agility, and are also tough, courageous flock guardians capable of running off sheep-steeling predators. The Briard is a close relative of the smooth-coated Beauceron, another French pasture breed known for its dual herding and guarding ability. By the 1800s, the Briard was a cherished French institution—even Napoleon, who had an aversion to dogs, was said to be a fan of the breed. The Briard was proudly exhibited at the very first French dog show, at Paris in 1865. By the time of World War I, the Briard was so much a part of the national character that it was named the official war dog of the French army, doing sentry duty, finding wounded soldiers, and pulling supply carts.Origin stories of Briards in America feature two towering figures in the War of Independence. Thomas Jefferson enters the story in 1789, at the end of his long tenure as America’s ambassador to France. Before he departed for home, the future President acquired a pregnant Briard named Bergère (“pd. for a chienne bergere big with pup, 36 libre,” he wrote in his memorandum book).Bergère and her pups proved to be magnificent herders and all-around working dogs at Jefferson’s Virginia estate, Monticello. But, as a Monticello historian wrote, “Bergère’s employment was secondary to her role as founder of the American branch of her family.” Indeed, Bergère and her brood, augmented by exports sent from France by Jefferson’s old friend and Revolutionary hero the Marquis de Lafayette, are thought to be the Briard’s foundation in the United States.In the many years since, Briard owners worldwide have echoed the words Jefferson wrote in praise of these remarkable dogs: “Their extraordinary sagacity renders them extremely valuable, capable of being taught almost any duty that may be required of them, and the most anxious in the performance of that duty, the most watchful and faithful of all servants.”","Black,Gray,Tawny,Black & Gray,Black & Tawny,Tawny & Gray,White"
affenpinscher,Affenpinscher,9-11.5 inches,7-10 pounds,12-15 years,Pinscher and Schnauzer,germany,"Though not classified as a terrier, the Affenpinscher was originally bred to work like one. His job was to exterminate rats and other pests in German stables of the 1600s. (The name Affenpinscher is German for “monkey dog” or “ape terrier.”) Eventually, Affens were brought indoors to rid the kitchen of mice. In time, they became dual-purpose dogs: ratters by day, and by night devoted bed-warming companions for the lady of the house.The Affen is thought to have been an influence on the development of such later European breeds as the Brussels Griffon and the Miniature Schnauzer. Clubs devoted to the breed sprung up around France and Germany in the late 1800s, and in 1936 the American Kennel Club welcomed Affens into its ranks. The immense charm that propelled them from stable to kitchen to boudoir has made Affens a force in the show ring. In 2013, an Affen named Banana Joe delighted America by winning the Westminster Kennel Club’s Best in Show. Affens have also succeeded in agility, obedience, and therapy.The grit that made them such effective ratters has never left the breed.

As far back as anyone knows, clan chieftans used packs of huge, shaggy hounds to pursue and bring down the wild red deer: swift 400-pounders with punishing antlers.

yorkshire_terrier,Yorkshire Terrier,7-8 inches,7 pounds,11-15 years,Terriers,great britain,"The Yorkshire Terrier was developed during the mid-1800s in the northern English counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire. It became a fashionable lapdog for proper English ladies in late Victorian times, but its beginnings were distinctly working-class.The breed is said to be the creation of weavers from Scotland who migrated to the English north country and brought their Scottish terriers with them. (We pause here to make the distinction between Scottish terriers, that is, terriers of Scotland, and the particular breed designated as Scottish Terriers.)Several breeds of now-extinct Scottish terriers are a part of the Yorkie’s genetic mix, along with such still-extant terriers as the Skye and Dandie Dinmont. One historical source suggests the addition of Maltese blood.The Scots weavers were proud of their tough little terriers, bred small enough to squeeze into the nooks and crannies of textile mills in pursuit of rodents. Jokes were made about the Yorkie’s long, silky coat, inferring that its finely textured hair was a product of the looms. The Yorkie’s home region was a center of mining as well as textile making, and many Yorkies were employed in coal mines as exterminators.The turning point in breed history came in 1886, when the Kennel Club (England) granted the Yorkie recognition. With this splash of publicity, the Yorkie became fashionable as a ladies’ companion. And, as the Yorkie’s popularity among the fashionable increased, its size decreased to better meet its new job description: adorable, amusing companion sitting in the lap of luxury.Yorkies were first seen in America in the 1870s, and the AKC recorded its first Yorkie, a female named Belle, in 1885.","Black & Gold,Black & Tan,Blue & Gold,Blue & Tan"
pug,Pug,10-13 inches,14-18 pounds,13-15 years,Companion and Toy Dogs,china,"The Pug, often called the Pug Dog, is an ancient breed that can be traced back some 2,000 years. The emperors of ancient China had a preference for flat-faced toy dogs—the Pekingese, Shih Tzu, and Pug were all developed as refined pets of the emperor, his family, and members of the imperial court. Like many breeds favored by Far Eastern potentates of the ancient world, Pugs were a closely held treasure that outsiders could acquire only as a gift.The Pug’s career as citizen of the world began sometime in the 1500s, when Dutch traders returned to Europe with specimens of the breed. Legend holds that the Pug became the mascot of Holland’s royal House of Orange when a Pug save the life of the Prince of Orange by barking to warn the prince of an attack on his camp by Spanish troops. When William and Mary of Orange arrived in England to assume the monarchy, their Pugs accompanied them and began a craze for the breed among the British.The worldwide fascination with Pugs can be gauged by how many names the breed has had in various eras and places: Lo-sze (China), Mopsi (Finland), Doguillo (Spain) are just a few. Among the Dutch, still closely associated with Pugs, they are known as Mophonds.Theories abound as to the origin of the name Pug. One suggests that Pug is based on the Latin word “pugnus,” meaning “fist”—the idea being that the dog’s face resembles a clenched fist.","Black,Fawn"

We read of him in the epic sagas of ancient times, we find his remains aside his Viking master along with the Viking’s sword and shield, proof of the high regard in which he was held; and in the Viste Cave at Jaeren, in western Norway, his skeleton was found among the stone tools in stratum dating from 4000 to 5000 b.c. Among the many oft-told tales associated with the breed is one from the 12th century, in which an Elkhound was named king in the land of Throndhjem.The name Elkhound acknowledges the breed’s age-old quarry, the giant elk, or moose. Elkhounds specialized in following the scent trail of these magnificent and dangerous creatures over a distance and holding them at bay while dodging attack until the trailing huntsmen arrived. Elkhounds look nothing like the droopy-eared, sleek-coated scenthounds developed in warmer climes, but they are classified as hounds by virtue of their job description: trailing and holding warm-blooded quarry.","Black & Gray,Black & Silver,Black White & Silver,Gray & Black,Gray Black & Silver,Silver & Black,Silver Gray & Black"
bloodhound,Bloodhound,"25-27 inches (male), 23-25 inches (female)","90-110 pounds (male), 80-100 pounds (female)",10-12 years,Scent hounds and related breeds,belgium,"There is little known about Bloodhound origins, but some authorities say the breed was known around the ancient Mediterranean. In his “Historia Animalium,” the third-century scholar Aelian mentions a hound of unrivaled scenting powers, so intensely devoted to his work that he could not be pulled off the trail until his quarry was found. The Bloodhound, then, appears to be oldest extant hound that hunts by scent and is a contributor to the development of subsequent hound breeds, such as the Black and Tan Coonhound and the other coonhound varieties.Bloodhounds as we know them were perfected in Western Europe about a thousand years ago. Credit for the careful development of the breed goes to high-ranking members of the pre-Reformation church. In medieval times, when even bishops rode to hounds, many prominent princes of the church maintained packs of hounds on the grounds of the well-funded monasteries of England and France. So careful were the monks charged with executing the bishop’s breeding program that their hounds came to be known as “blooded hounds” —“blooded” meaning “of aristocratic blood.”During the centuries since, the noble Bloodhound has earned a reputation as a man-trailer without equal. Police departments around the world have relied on these muscular, single-minded hounds to follow the scent of humans—maybe a criminal, or a lost child, or a confused senior. An assignment might last all day and night, over hills and through swamps, but Bloodhounds won’t give up until they follow the trail to the end. Even in these days of high-technology, no scenting device yet invented is as accurate as the Bloodhound nose.","Black & Tan,Liver & Tan,Red"

They might choose to shoot it out with the gamekeeper when cornered, rather than face the gallows.Gamekeepers responded by breeding dogs big, swift, and brave enough to pursue and pin a man prowling the grounds in the dead of night. Eventually they hit upon just the right combination of breeding stock by crossing Mastiffs to Bulldogs at a ratio of 60 percent Mastiff and 40 percent Bulldog. The new breed was smart enough to work on command, tractable enough to hold but not maul a poacher, a big enough to scare the bejesus out of any intruder.Inevitably, rivalries developed among Britain’s gamekeepers over who had the best-quality Bullmastiffs. Competitions and exhibitions of the best specimens were staged, and from there it was but a short leap for the Bullmastiff into the show ring. Dog shows in England were gaining in popularity just as Bullmastiff fanciers were standardizing their breed. By 1924, the Bullmastiff as we now know it was ready to join the ranks of the Kennel Club (England). The AKC granted the breed full recognition in 1933.","Fawn,Red"

The “Bobtail,” as the breed is often known, was most likely developed in the west of England, in the counties of Devon and Somerset and the Duchy of Cornwall.The name Old English Sheepdog is something of a misnomer. As a creature of the late 1700s, the OES is not particularly old by canine standards. By blood, they aren’t fully English; possible OES component breeds include dogs of Scotch, European, and Russian ancestry. And, technically, they aren’t even sheepdogs: OES were employed primarily as drovers who moved cattle over dusty country roads, from the pasture to town markets. In Germany, around the same time, the Rottweiler was building a similar reputation as a “butcher’s dog.” In some pastures, shepherds would shear the OES blue-gray and white coat once a year and use the clippings to make yarn for clothing.With their full coat, free and powerful gait, and warm personality, OES show well in the ring. They were present at the sport’s very beginnings. Stockmen have been exhibiting their OES in England since 1865. The AKC registered its first OES in 1888, and in 1914 the breed made its debut appearance in the winner’s circle at Westminster Kennel Club.Their looks and intelligence make OES natural actors, seen to good effect in Disney’s “The Shaggy Dog” and “The Shaggy D.A.” Among the most famous real-life OES was Paul McCartney’s Martha, who inspired the Beatles song “Martha My Dear.”","Blue & White,Blue Gray & White,Blue Merle & White,Gray & White,Grizzle & White,Black & White,Blue,Brown & White,Fawn & White,Gray,Grizzle,White"

The breed began its steady climb to supreme popularity in the early 1800s, when Labs were spotted by English nobles visiting Canada. These sporting earls and lords returned to England with fine specimens of “Labrador dogs.” (Exactly how these dogs of Newfoundland became associated with Labrador is unclear, but the name stuck.) During the latter half of the 19th century, British breeders refined and standardized the breed.The physical and temperamental breed traits, so familiar today to millions of devotees around the world, recall the Lab’s original purpose. A short, dense, weather-resistant coat was preferred because during a Canadian winter longhaired retrievers would be encrusted with ice when coming out of the water. In its ancestral homeland, a Lab would be assigned to a fishing boat to retrieve the fish that came off the trawl. Accordingly, in addition to having natural instincts as a retriever, the dog required a coat suited to the icy waters of the North Atlantic.The Lab’s thick, tapering tail—an “otter tail,” it’s called— serves as a powerful rudder, constantly moving back and forth as the dog swims and aids the dog in turning. As for the breed’s characteristic temperament, it is as much a hallmark of the breed as the otter tail. “The ideal disposition is one of a kindly, outgoing, tractable nature; eager to please and nonagressive towards man or animal,” the breed standard says. “The Labrador has much that appeals to people; his gentle ways, intelligence and adaptability make him an ideal dog.” When defining a Lab’s primary attributes, the most important might be temperament since his utility depends on his disposition. “If a dog does not possess true breed temperament,” wrote a noted dog judge, “he is not a Labrador.”The Kennel Club (England) recognized the Lab in 1903, and the AKC registered its first dog of the breed in 1917. Labs topped AKC registrations for the first time in 1991 and has reigned as America’s favorite breed ever since.","Black,Chocolate,Yellow"

norfolk_terrier,Norfolk Terrier,9-10 inches,11-12 pounds,12-16 years,Terriers,great britain,"Frank “Roughrider” Jones, an English dog breeder and horseman of the early 20th century, developed little red terriers as ratters and fox bolters. In the beginning, the Norwich (ears up) and Norfolk (ears down) were considered one breed. In England and North America both dogs were first classified as Norwich Terriers, sometimes called Jones Terriers.Over time, the two types diverged. In 1964, after much debate among fanciers, the Kennel Club (England) recognized the Norfolk as a distinct breed. But, as a British authority of the time explained, “Actually, there is nothing new about the Norfolk Terrier, but simply the name under which it is registered. The Eastern counties have always produced these principally wheaten, red, and otherwise black-and-tan or grizzle good-ribbed short-legged terriers. … They go to ground readily and are famous ratters.” The Canadian Kennel Club officially accepted the Norfolk and Norwich as separate breeds in 1977, as did the AKC two years later.The names of both breeds refer to their place of origin, the East Anglia town of Norwich in the county of Norfolk that lies just north of London. Among the older terrier breeds thought to factor into the fearless and fun-loving Norfolk’s development include the Border, Cairn, and Glen of Imaal terriers.","Black & Tan,Grizzle,Red,Brown,Wheaten"
papillon,Papillon,8-11 inches,5-10 pounds,14-16 years,Companion and Toy,France,"Papillons were originally bred as charming and attentive companions for noblewomen, and for hundreds of years these enchanting lap warmers were great favorites in the royal courts of Europe. They appear in many portraits of long-ago queens and princesses painted by Europe’s most renowned artists. Rubens, Rembrandt, Goya, and Toulouse-Lautrec are among the masters who included Papillons in their paintings. Paps were developed in Renaissance times by crossing existing toy breeds with spaniels (the breed’s early ancestors were known as “dwarf spaniels”) in keeping with the era’s mania among nobles for miniaturized versions of their favorite breeds. The sporting-spaniel blood in the Pap’s background might explain why these dainty dynamos are among the more athletic and biddable toy dogs in the canine kingdom. With admirers like Madame de Pompadour, Louis XIV, and Marie Antoinette (whose Pap, named Thisbe, stood faithfully outside the prison where the hapless queen awaited beheading), the breed’s French connection is strong. But it was in the early breeding centers of Italy and Spain that Paps were refined and popularized.

brabancon_griffon,Brabancon Griffon,7-10 inches,8-10 pounds,12-15 years,Scent hounds and related breeds,france,"Griffon-type dogs were well known in Europe for centuries. In Van Eyck’s celebrated 1434 portrait of the “Arnolfini Couple,” we glimpse a distant ancestor of the Griff. It’s a small, griffon-type dog with a longer muzzle than today’s flatter-faced, pouty-lipped version.The Griff’s story, however, properly begins in Brussels, Belgium’s capital city, in the early 1800s. It was then that the Griff began his rise from rough-and-tumble rat dog to sophisticated laptop companion.The coachmen of Brussels commonly kept small terrier-type dogs to keep down the rat population in their stables. These were typically Affenpinscher-like dogs known as “griffons d’ecurie,” or “wire-coated stable dogs.” The hack drivers experimented with various crosses to improve their dogs.No written records of these breedings survive, but dog people have surmised that the Pug, English Toy Spaniels, an old Belgian breed called the Brabancon, and perhaps even Yorkshire Terrier, were all part of the genetic mix that produced the Brussels Griffon.The turning point of Griff history came in the 1870s, when the dog-loving Henrietta Maria, Queen of the Belgians, took a liking to the breed. With royal patronage, the Griff’s future was assured. They became all the rage among the queen’s courtiers, and kennel keepers of the upper classes further refined the breed, making the body smaller and the face more humanlike.The royal boost received by the breed led to international interest, and Griffs were exported to England and America. The AKC registered its first Griff in 1910. As is the case with so many European breeds, the two world wars decimated the Griff population. If not for the dedication of U.S. and British enthusiasts, the breed might not have survived.The Brussels Griffon won millions of new fans in 1997, when a spicy Griff named Jill upstaged Jack Nicholson in the hit movie “As Good As It Gets.”","Belge,Black,Black & Tan,Red,Blue,Brown,Chocolate,Tan,Wheaten"

It can be reliably stated, however, that they were created by breeding the indigenous large dogs of Britain to the Middle Eastern coursing hounds that were bartered around the known world in the earliest days of international trade.By the time the Roman Empire had gained a toehold in the British Isles, the giant hounds of Ireland were already long established. In the year 391 the Roman consul received a gift of seven of these hounds that “all Rome viewed with wonder.” These majestic hunters, whose motto was “Gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked,” were used on such quarry as the now-extinct Irish elk, a massive, ferocious beast said to stand six feet at the shoulder.In 15th-century Ireland, wolves were overrunning the countryside. The Irish hounds, already renowned big-game hunters, began to specialize on wolves. By the late 1700s, when wolves and other big-game animals of Ireland were hunted to extinction, IWs lost their job and nearly went extinct themselves. This was a case of a breed doing its job too well for its own good.In 1862, British army captain George Augustus Graham began scouring the country for remaining specimens of Ireland’s national hound. Graham made it his life’s work to protect, standardize, and promote the breed, and today his name is still spoken with reverence wherever IW fanciers gather.Among the many Irish legends inspired by the breed is the melancholy tale of loyalty and remorse “Gelert, the Faithful Hound.”","Black,Blue,Brindle,Cream,Gray,Gray & Brindle,Red,Red & Brindle,Silver,Wheaten,Wheaten & Brindle,White"

But what we think of today as a Boxer can be traced to Germany of the late 1800s and early 20th century. The breed is thought to have been bred down by German dog fanciers from a larger, heavier German breed called the Bullenbeisser (“bull biter”).In medieval times the Bullenbeisser was Germany’s premier big-game hunter, used by noblemen to run down, catch, and hold such formidable opponents as bear, bison, and wild boar on vast ducal estates. By the early 1800s, the political situation in the German states was changing. German nobles were out of favor. Their estates were broken up, and the cherished tradition of lavishly appointed boar hunts came to an end. By 1865, the mighty Bullenbeisser was out of a job.Through judicious crosses to a smaller, mastiff-type breed from England, the obsolete big-game hunter gained a new lease on life. By the late 1800s, the modern Boxer—a sleeker, more elegant dog—had come into focus. (The English name Boxer refers to the way the breed spars, like a prizefighter, with their front paws when playing or defending themselves.)Over the years, Boxers have done many jobs: athlete, cattle dog, police dog, war dog (in both world wars), watchdog, protection dog, and guide dog for the blind. The AKC registered its first Boxer in 1904, but the breed’s U.S. heyday began in the 1950s, when a Westminster-winning Boxer named Bang Away became a national celebrity. Since that time, Boxers have reigned as one of America’s top 10 most popular breeds.","Brindle,Fawn,White"

In some countries, the Malinois is classified together with the Tervuren, Laekenois, and Belgian Shepherd (aka Groenendael) as a single breed collectively known as the Belgian Sheepdog. In America, the Malinois has been registered as a separate breed since 1959. He bears a passing resemblance to the German Shepherd Dog but has a different head, and is leggier and finer boned, than his better-known German counterpart.Mals have long been acknowledged as a peerless livestock herder in their native land. They were first bred by serious dog people who were primarily concerned with producing dogs of sterling working character and who spurned passing fads and fancies of pet owners. This emphasis on performance made the Mal the go-to dog for Belgian sheepherders and cattlemen.It was in 1911 that Mals were first brought to America. They flourished here until the outbreak of World War II put an end to the importation of European breeding stock. The breed languished in the postwar years until the early 1960s, when the Mal’s admirers began the process of replenishing its American population.Mals are still prized as herders of all kinds of stock, but their versatility and high work-drive have opened careers in many other occupations and activities. They are highly sought after as police and military K-9s.

It was the dog-loving Victoria, during her many extended stays at Balmoral Castle on the Scottish Highlands, who popularized the local herding breed among her courtiers and subjects during the second half of the 19th century. Her enthusiasm for Collies began the breed’s ascent from humble shepherd dog to worldwide canine superstar.It is supposed that the Collie’s ancestors reached Scotland nearly 2,000 years before Victoria did, brought by the Romans during their conquest of Britain in the first century of the Common Era. Over several centuries, the Roman herding stock was interbred with local dogs. Sometime during this long unwritten history, we can surmise that a stouthearted sheepherding dog recognizable as the Collie came into focus. (A prevalent theory holds that the name Collie derives from the name of a particular strain of black-faced sheep called colleys.)The Collie enters the written record around 1800, and by the time Victoria “discovered” the Collie later in the century, the breed’s now familiar characteristics were set. In 20th-century America, author and dog breeder Albert Payson Terhune popularized the breed for generations of eager young readers, who thrilled at adventures of the Sunnybank Collies. In 1940, British author Eric Knight launched one of the great pop-culture franchises of all time with his novel Lassie Come-Home. Thanks to Knight’s books, spin-off movies, and a long-running TV show, Lassie made Collies the ideal canine companion of every child’s fantasy.","Black White & Tan,Blue Merle & White,Blue Merle White & Tan,Sable,Sable & White,Sable Merle & White,White,Black & Tan Markings,Sable"

In Germany, the Standard Schnauzer is known as the Mittelschnauzer (“medium Schnauzer”).During the long centuries before mechanized agriculture, the world’s farmers strove to breed versatile dogs to use as all-purpose helpers. The farmers of different regions found diverse solutions to the same challenge, resulting in such varied breeds as the Kerry Blue Terrier (Ireland), Rat Terrier (United States), and Belgian Tervuren. Germany’s entry in the quest for an ideal farm dog was the breed that would come to be known as the Schnauzer.A creation of the Middle Ages, the breed came of age in the verdant farm country of Bavaria. Like the world’s other barn-and-stable breeds, multitasking Schnauzers made their bones as ratters, herders, guardians, and hunters. Standards bear a superficial resemblance to several terrier breeds of Britain, but the breed is a product of Continental herders and working dogs.During the birth of Europe’s organized show scene in the 1870s, the “Wire-haired Pinscher” proved to be a dashing show dog. By the turn of the century, fanciers began exhibiting the breed as the Schnauzer (“whiskered snout”). Schnauzers were in America since at least 1900, but it took until the ’20s before they clicked with pet owners.

Von Stephanitz and like-minded breeders crossed various strains from the northern and central districts of Germany, resulting in the ancestors of today’s German Shepherd Dog (GSD).Von Stephanitz co-founded the world’s first club devoted to GSDs and spent 35 years promoting and refining the breed. Today, the GSD’s versatility is so thoroughly deployed in the performance of myriad tasks that it is easy to forget that the breed was originally created to herd sheep. The GSD’s now-famous qualities—intelligence, agility, speed, stealth, and the overall air of firm authority—were forged not in the police academy but in the sheep pasture.GSDs became popular in the United States in the early 1900s, thanks in part to the adventures of canine movie stars Rin-Tin-Tin and Strongheart. The GSD is among those German breeds, the Dachshund is another, that suffered from anti-German sentiment during and after the world wars. In World War I–era Britain, the breed was referred to as the Alsatian, a name many British dog lovers still prefer.With the rise of modern livestock management and the decline of herding as a canine occupation, von Stephanitz shrewdly promoted his breed as an ideal K-9 worker. The GSD is today the preferred dog for police and military units the world over.","Bi-Color,Black,Black & Cream,Black & Red,Black & Silver,Black & Tan,Blue,Gray,Liver,Sable,White"

Even the breed name is a shrouded in mystery. Some experts say it derives from the Gaelic word beag (“little”), while others point to the French term for the sound hounds make while hunting: be’geule.There are reports of small pack-hounds employed to hunt rabbit and hare in England long before the Roman legions arrived in 55 B.C. An English authority called the Beagle the “foothound of our country, indigenous to the soil.” By the 1500s, most English gentlemen had packs of large hounds that tracked deer, and smaller hounds that tracked hares. The smaller, more compact hounds were ancestors of our modern Beagle.The phrase “foot hound” is vital to understanding the Beagle’s broad appeal for hunters in England, the Continent, and North America. Unlike larger pack hunters like foxhounds or Harriers, the Beagle could be hunted on foot—no horse was necessary. Those who couldn’t afford to feed and stable a mount, and ladies and gentlemen too old spend a hard day thundering across the countryside on horseback, could easily keep up with a pack of Beagles on foot.Beagles imports began arriving in America in the years after the Civil War, and their popularity among U.S. rabbit hunters was immediate. The AKC registered its first Beagle, named Blunder, in 1885. To this day, “beaglers” in woodsy areas of North America still swear by their breed’s great nose, musical voice, and enthusiastic approach to rabbit hunting.","Black & Tan,Black Red & White,Black Tan & Bluetick,Black Tan & White,Black White & Tan,Blue Tan & White,Brown & White,Brown White & Tan,Lemon & White,Red & White,Tan & White,Black,Black & White,Black Fawn & White,Black Tan & Redtick,Blue,Blue & White,Brown,Lemon,Red,Red & Black,Red Black & White,Tan,White,White Black & Tan,Ticked,Spotted"

Early authorities say the breed precedes the Pointer in development. Evidence in sportsmen’s writings suggest the English Setter was originally produced from crosses of the Spanish pointer, the large water spaniel, and the Springer Spaniel.The Setter was developed to lay down quietly, or “set,” when they located game birds. This style of hunting at the time would then require the hunter to cast a net in the area, sometimes covering the dog as well, and flush and harvest the birds that were ensnared. This low-lying method was ideal for net hunting as a standing dog on point would be much more easily tangled in the net. Any breed that “set” was branded a setter, but ultimately, the Setting Spaniel’s keen nose and superiority in finding birds made it the best choice in the selective breeding that developed dogs for this particular purpose. In the 18th century, firearms replaced the nets and further selective breeding developed an upright point in Setters, the better to see the dog from a distance. The 19th century saw a divergence of Setters into different breeds, evolving based on their location and the terrain in which they hunted.Considerable credit for the development of the modern Setter goes to Edward Laverack of England, who, in 1825, obtained “Ponto” and “Old Moll,” products of a 35-year-old English Setter line. Another prominent figure in this breed’s development was R. LL. Purcell Llewellyn of Wales. Though he had bought his dogs from Laverack, Llewellyn’s focus was on field performance, unlike Laverack, who is mostly associated with the show Setter. Once the breed was exported to America in the 19th century, C.N. Myers of Blue Bar Kennels in Pennsylvania played a major role in the development of the English Setter in the states.","Blue Belton & Tan (Tri-Color),White"
toy_poodle,Toy Poodle,No more than 10 inches,4-6 pounds,10-18 years,Companion and Toy Dogs,france,"The Poodle is the national dog of France, and the French sure do love their Poodles. There is, however, no such breed as the “French Poodle.” In France, Poodles are known as the Caniche, or “duck dog.”Despite the Poodle’s association with France, the breed originated as a duck hunter in Germany, where the word “pudelin” refers to splashing in water. The Standard Poodle began its development as a retrieving water dog more than 400 years ago. With a crisp, curly coat as protection against the elements, superlative swimming ability, and off-the-charts intelligence, the Poodle was, and still is, a magnificent retriever. (The Standard is the only breed classified as a non-sporting dog that is eligible for AKC Retriever Hunting Tests.)The flamboyant Poodle show coat served a practical purpose in the breed’s early years. Hunters wanted their dogs to have free range of movement in the water, but they also wished to protect vital areas of the anatomy from the cold. They shaved the legs, neck, and tail but left the chest, hips, and leg joints coated. The rounded tufts on the legs, hips, and tail tip are called pompons. (Note the spelling: Cheerleaders have pom-poms; Poodles have pompons.)The Poodle’s many fine qualities allowed it to move from the lake to the lap of luxury. Elegant Poodles of the Standard and Miniature varieties found favor among the nobles of France and, eventually, all of Europe. The breed’s showy looks and trainability made it a natural entertainer, and Poodles have long been associated with the European circus tradition. An excellent nose brought the Poodle additional work as a truffle hunter.The Standard was bred down to the Miniature. The Toy was first bred in America, in the early 20th century, as a city-dwelling companion dog. Well-bred specimens of each variety are exact replicas of each other and are bred to the same standard.","Apricot,Black,Blue,Brown,Cream,Gray,Red,Silver,White,Black & Apricot,Black & Brown,Black & Cream,Black & Gray,Black & Red,Black & Silver,Black & Tan,Black & White,Blue & White,Brown & Apricot,Brown & White,Cream & White,Gray & White,Red & Apricot,Red & White,White & Apricot,White & Silver"
sealyham_terrier,Sealyham Terrier,10.5 inches,"23-24 pounds (male), slightly less (females)",12-14 years,Terriers,great britain,"The name Sealyham Terrier honors the Sealy Ham estate on the Seal River, in southwestern Wales, where this sturdy and confident terrier was first bred. The father of the breed was an army captain named John Edwardes, who in the mid-1800s retired at age 40 and spent the rest of his life developing his dream dog.The Sealy’s primary purpose was to work in support of the captain’s Otterhound pack. Otters in those days were considered pests who depleted the fish population on sprawling estates like Sealy Ham. Edwardes bred his terrier to be strong and tough enough to dig razor-clawed otters out of their lairs. Edwardes left behind no written records of his breedings, and modern authorities disagree as to the exact pedigree of the captain’s original Sealys. Among the breed names bandied about in their theories are the Bull, Dandie Dinmont, and West Highland White terriers. Whatever the exact breed mix, the captain succeeded admirably, creating a fearless, hardworking hunter who was also a delightful companion by the fireside. The years between the world wars were the breed’s American heyday. Sealys won Westminster’s Best in Show award three times in this era, among them was the most famous show dog of the Prohibition era, a Sealy named Bootlegger. Their high profile was further boosted by A-list Hollywood owners like Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper, and Cary Grant.Sealy popularity with pet owners has waned since those heady days—puzzling, considering the breed’s many fine qualities. “They could be one of the best-kept secrets in dogs,” says one Sealy lover. The breed today is a bit larger and more affable than the feisty terriers first bred by Captain Edwardes. Their friendliness is put to good use as therapy workers in nursing homes and children’s hospitals.",White
west_highland_white_terrier,West Highland White Terrier,"11 inches (male). 10 inches, female",15-20 pounds,13-15 years,Terriers,great britain,"The nobles, landed gentry, and poor farmers of the long-ago British Isles all faced the same problem: infestations of rodents that pillaged grain stores and carried disease. The solution was the development of a vast array of terriers called earthdogs, adept at finding and dispatching rats.It is thought that the terriers of Scotland—including the Westie, Cairn, Skye, Scottish, and Dandie Dinmont terriers—are all branches of the same family tree. The exact beginnings of the Westie’s forerunners are, in the poetic words of one historian, “cloaked within the mists of the Scottish hills.”The breed we know today as the West Highland White Terrier comes into historical focus in the 1700s, when the Malcolm clan began breeding the little white exterminators on their estate, called Poltalloch. They were bred and maintained there for more than 100 years prior to their appearance at dog shows. It is probable that the lineage of the Malcolm dogs goes back to the time of King James I, who asked for some “earth-doggies” out of Argyleshire. The breed was sometimes known as the Poltalloch Terrier; an alternate name was the Roseneath Terrier, named for another Scottish estate where early breedings were done.By 1896, when the breed was first shown at Scottish dog shows, it was known as the West Highland White Terrier, referring to the northwest part of Scotland where Westies earned their fame. Westies were first shown at AKC shows in 1906. Amusing, spunky, and portable, the Westie has been a popular companion dog in America for well over a hundred years. Juicy Couture and Black & White Scotch whisky are two of the brands that have used the Westie’s delightful image to attract customers.",White

The Swiss utilized these mastiff-types when breeding their Alpine mountain dogs, or Sennenhund. Of these, Swissies are the oldest and the largest (or, the “greater”).In remote mountain passes they toiled as all-around farm-and-pasture hands, specializing in hauling loads of meat and dairy to market in smartly outfitted dogcarts. The Greater Swiss is closely related to the Bernese Mountain Dog and is a component breed of the Saint Bernard and Rottweiler.","Black, White & Red,Blue White & Tan,Red & White"
dingo,Dingo,"18-20 inches (male), 17-19 inches (female)"," 30-55 pounds",12-16 years,Spitz and primitive types,greenland,"When primitive humans migrated across the Bering land bridge from Asia into North America, they brought with them a primitive form of dog that were domesticated from Asian wolves thousands of years earlier. Skeletal and mummified remains of these dogs have been discovered alongside other artifacts belonging to the Southwest Indians and from there, they moved further into Central and South America and over to the eastern United States. Archaeologists discovered similar canine remains in ceremonial burials in the southeastern forests, denoting their companionship with Native Americans long before Europeans arrived.Recent studies of free-ranging dogs of the Southeast and Southwest suggest a close ancestry and possible descent from these primitive companions based on appearance, behavior, and ecology. These free-ranging dogs were named Carolina Dogs by Dr. I. Lehr Brisbin, who initially made contact with the breed in the Southeast.","Black,Black & Tan,Buff,Red,Tawny,White,Yellow,Piebald"
english_springer,English Springer,"20 inches (male), 19 inches (female)","50 pounds (male), 40 pounds (female)",12-14 years,Retrievers,great britain,"During the long history of Britain’s land spaniels, dogs described as “cockers” or “springers” were often born in the same litter. It would take many generations of careful, purposeful breeding before such sporting spaniels as the English Springer Spaniel, English Cocker Spaniel, and Field Spaniel could be sorted into the distinct breeds we know today.England’s springer-type spaniel first emerged centuries ago to work on upland game birds. Before the invention of the wheel-lock firearm in the 17th century, springing spaniels worked in tandem with hunters who brought down their quarry with nets, falcons, or bows, or some combination of these. After the hunting rifle revolutionized the sport, springers quickly earned a reputation as eager and reliable gundogs.The English Springer’s job is to detect game birds in high grass or bramble, flush or “spring” the birds from their cover, then point and retrieve the downed bird. Breed literature tells us that Springers will work relentlessly all day in the field and then, in the words of one historian, “retire to the easy companionship of family, hearth, and home after a good day’s hunt.”At the first British dog shows, in the 1870s, English and Welsh Springer Spaniels were exhibited as the same breed. This held until 1902, when the Kennel Club (England) recognized the two Springers separately. English Springers gained their first great North American fame in the 1920s, and they soon made their mark as a tough but stylish gundog in the bird fields of America and Canada. The English Springer Spaniel Field Trial Association, the breed’s AKC parent club, held its first meeting in 1924. In recent years, the breed’s trainability, durability, and keen nose have been used to great advantage in K-9 detection work.","Black & White,Black White & Tan,Liver & White,Liver White & Tan,White & Black,White & Liver,Lemon & White,Orange & White,Red & White,Roan,Spotted,Ticked"
brittany_spaniel,Brittany Spaniel,17.5-20.5 inches,30-40 pounds,12-14 years,Pointing Dogs,france,"Brittany is the westernmost region of France, surrounded by the English Channel to the north and the Bay of Biscay to the south. It was here, hundreds of years ago, that French hunters developed what is today considered one of the world’s most versatile bird dogs, capable of working on duck, woodcock, pheasant, partridge—just about anything with feathers.The Brittany first comes into historical focus in paintings and tapestries of the 17th century. The frequency with which Brittany-type dogs appear in the portraits and pastoral scenes by French, Flemish, and Dutch masters of the period suggest that liver-and-white pointing dogs were quite common in Western Europe.The Brittany is a rustic dog whose original devotees were medieval peasants and poachers, people for whom thriftiness was a way of life. Unable to support a full kennel, they placed a premium on dogs capable of being all-purpose workers. The versatility bred into Brittanys in the long-ago French countryside has never left the breed.The Brittany was introduced to America in 1931. In 1934, the AKC registered its first dog of the breed, then called the Brittany Spaniel. (In France, the breed is still known as “l’épagneul Breton,” or Brittany Spaniel.) During the 20th century, American and French lines diverged. By mid-century, the U.S. breed fancy considered their Brittanys more pointers than spaniels in working style, and the AKC breed named was shortened to Brittany in 1982.Under any classification, Brittanys are happy, durable hunting companions prized for stamina and an excellent nose for birds. They are among America’s most popular and successful field dogs. Over the years, hundreds of Brittanys have earned the AKC’s elusive Dual Champion title, indicating a dog that is both a handsome showman in the ring and a capable gundog in the field.","Liver & White,Liver White & Orange,Orange & White,White & Liver,White & Orange,Black & White,Black White & Orange,White Black & Orange,Roan,Spotted,Ticked"
maltese_dog,Maltese Dog,7-9 inches,under 7 pounds,12-15 years,Companion and Toy Dogs,central mediterranean basin,"Malta lies 60 miles due south of Sicily, in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. In ancient times, the island was a crossroads for pilgrims, mariners, and wealthy merchants from three continents. As far back as 3500 B.C. Malta was a thriving seaport and a seat of finance and culture.During a 2,000-year period beginning in 1500 B.C. this strategic gateway was conquered and occupied by successive waves of seafaring empire-builders—Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs, and Normans—for whom the island was a clearinghouse for precious commodities, such as spices, silks, gemstones, and a certain little white lapdog favored by leisured ladies the world over. It is likely that the Maltese was introduced to Malta by the Phoenicians, who ruled the Mediterranean before the rise of Greece.The Greeks of the fourth and fifth centuries B.C. were fascinated by the Maltese’s geometric beauty and left behind a rich legacy of breed-specific treasures: The “Melitaie Dog” is depicted on Golden Age ceramics, and Aristotle refers to it as “perfectly proportioned,” notwithstanding a diminutive stature.Aristocrats of the Roman Empire perfected the Maltese’s role of status symbol and fashion statement. A Roman matron wasn’t fully dressed without a “Roman Ladies’ Dog” peeking out of her sleeve or bosom. Even the crusty Emperor Claudius succumbed to the breed’s charm. The Maltese was a persistent motif in Roman myths, poems, and fables in which the breed symbolized loyalty. One legend concerns Saint Paul, the peripatetic apostle of early Christianity. The Acts of the Apostles recounts Paul’s shipwreck on Malta, where he miraculously healed the father of the island’s Roman governor, Publius. The grateful Publius, so the story goes, presented Paul with a Maltese.After the fall of Rome, it was Chinese breeders who kept the Maltese from extinction during Europe’s Dark Ages. The Chinese effected judicious crosses with their native toy breeds and exported a more refined Maltese back to Europe. With its immense charm and eye-catching looks, it comes as no surprise that the Maltese was a fixture at dog shows from the very beginning. At New York’s first Westminster show, in 1877, the breed was exhibited as the Maltese Lion Dog.","White,White & Lemon,White & Tan"
curly-coated_retriever,Curly-Coated Retriever,"25-27 inches (male), 23-25 inches (female)",60-95 pounds,10-12 years,Retrievers,great britain,"Curlies are thought to be among the oldest of the retriever breeds. In contrast to spaniels and setters, though, retrievers are newbies on the sporting scene. They arrived only in the late 1700s, after wing shooting with rifles became practical.The genetic jigsaw puzzle that is the Curly-Coated Retriever was pieced together in England during the 1800s. No written records of the breed’s earliest history exist, but we can make some educated assumptions. The Curly is popularly believed to be descended from two breeds now extinct, the English Water Spaniel and the Retrieving Setter. It is assumed that Irish Water Spaniel blood is also among the Curly’s ancestor breeds, as was the St. John’s Dog, a smallish type of Newfoundland. By 1860, their unique look and proud bearing made Curlies popular attractions at England’s first dog shows.In the early 1880s, the Curly was said to have been crossed to the Poodle to tighten the Curly’s distinctive, low-shedding curls. Poodle blood might have also contributed to the Curly’s elegant carriage and complex character.By the late 19th century the Curly had taken his place as a cherished companion of British sportsmen. In this period the Curly was exported as far afield as Australia and New Zealand, where it remains popular among hunters as an all-purpose retriever admired for a steady disposition and tender mouth.The spectacular rise of Labs and Goldens has long since eclipsed the Curly’s prominence among the retriever breeds, but they retain a small but ardent following around the world. The Curly entered the AKC Stud Book in 1924.","Black,Liver"

In certain precincts of 19th century Germany, the reception was downright hostile. All too aware of this was taxman and dog breeder Louis Dobermann, from the town of Apolda. He hoped to breed an imposing but dependable protector to accompany him on his rounds.Dobermann’s handiwork was a larger, less refined version of the pinscher that today bears his name (minus the extra “n,” which was dropped somewhere along the way). Historians mention the Black and Tan Terrier (forerunner of the Manchester Terrier), German Pinscher, Rottweiler, and smooth-coated herding dogs among the components of Dobermann’s new breed. The “Tax Collector’s Dog” quickly gained an international reputation as a working dog supreme. Dobermans have excelled at police and military K-9 duty, as therapy dogs and service dogs for the disabled, as search-and-rescuers, and in competitive dog sports. During World War II, the U.S. Marine Corps Dobermans of the Pacific won the breed great fame. Twenty-five of these loyal “Devil Dogs” died during the battle for Guam. With their muscular good looks and proud gait, Doberman Pinschers are consistent winners in the ring. A dog named Storm won Westminster’s Best in Show two years running, in 1952 and ’53. The Doberman Pinscher came to the AKC in 1908 and has since reigned as one of America’s most popular working breeds.","Black & Rust,Blue & Rust,Fawn (Isabella) & Rust,Red & Rust,White"

They were employed by farmers to herd sheep, ponies, and poultry. (“Toonie dog” was an old slang name for Shelties, “toon” being a Shetland word for farm.)There’s a reason why the Sheltie was bred smaller than his close cousin, the rough-coat Collie. Thanks to their compact size, the Sheltie eats less than the Collie and other large herding dogs. This is an important consideration in the harsh, cold climate of the breed’s homeland, where food can be scarce. This also explains the diminutive size of Shetland ponies.Exactly when Collies were imported to the island from the Scottish mainland and bred down to Sheltie size is a detail lost to history, as the islands’ breeders left behind no written records. And, because the islands were so inaccessible, Shelties lived in virtual isolation from other breeds and were nearly unknown in the rest of Britain until the early 20th century.The Sheltie was first recognized by the Kennel Club (England), as the Shetland Collie, in 1909. Under pressure from Collie fanciers, the breed name was changed soon after to Shetland Sheepdog.

english_foxhound,English Foxhound,24 inches,60-75 pounds,10-13 years,Scent hounds and related breeds,great britain,"In medieval England, aristocrats and their hounds hunted stag in the vast forests that had overtaken Britain during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of the Roman Empire. The killing of foxes, those wily henhouse poachers, was considered merely a chore for lowly farmers and groundskeepers. This changed with the waning of the Middle Ages. As the population grew, the forests receded and the deer population dwindled. The British gentry, wishing to continue their ritualized horses-and-hounds pastime, slowly phased out stag hunting in favor of a new type of quarry: the red fox. The traditional British foxhunt, with packs of bawling hounds and mounted hunters thundering over rolling acres of lawn and hedge, began in the 1600s. “Masters of hounds” developed a dog for this lordly pastime by breeding big stag-hunting hounds (for nose and endurance) to leggy Greyhound-type hounds (for speed and agility). The result was the English Foxhound, whose form and demeanor remain remarkably unchanged today. By the 1700s, foxhunts were all the rage among the English upper crust. Colonial American sportsmen, including George Washington and his wealthy Virginia neighbors, recreated a bit of their mother country by staging English-style foxhunts on their plantations. Washington was a key figure in creating the American Foxhound, a slimmer, taller hound developed by crosses of English Foxhounds to imported French hounds from the kennels of the Marquis de Lafayette. It is likely also that English Foxhound blood courses through the veins of coonhound breeds developed by American frontiersmen.","Black White & Tan,Lemon & White,White"

Nobles would stage ritualized hunts—festivals, really—on their vast estates, with their guests, horses, and hounds ferried in on special hunt trains. It wasn’t unusual for a hundred Borzoi and just as many servants to be employed in these extravagant affairs, which traditionally concluded with a great feast at the manor house.“It is difficult today to even imagine the grand scale and magnificence to which the gentle Borzoi is heir,” wrote a breed historian. “Before 1861, and to a lesser extent after that time up to the Russian Revolution in 1917, the time, effort, and money expended on these ‘hunts,’ as they were called, is surely unequaled in the development of any breed.” Russia’s great novelist Leo Tolstoy, himself a devoted Borzoi fan, immortalized one of these grand spectacles in his War and Peace.With the Revolution came the wholesale slaughter of the Romanov family, their nobles, and their aristocratic hounds. This was a disaster that set back Russian breeding of Borzoi and other national breeds for much of the 20th century. If not for the Borzoi’s devotees abroad, the breed might have gone extinct.In the years leading up to the Revolution, dog fanciers in England and America had begun the importation of Borzoi to their shores. These early imports ensured the breed’s survival. In the English-speaking world, the breed name was Russian Wolfhound. In America this changed in 1936, when after a long and spirited debate pro and con among the U.S. breed fancy, the breed was officially rechristened the Borzoi, from the Russian borzyi, meaning “swift.”By all accounts, this noble breed of haughty looks and sterling temperament is little changed from the hounds Tolstoy described so movingly in his writings.","Black,Black & Brindle,Black & Cream,Black & Tan,Brindle,Cream,Gold,Red,Sable,White,Apricot,Blue,Blue & Cream,Brown,Fawn,Silver"

There is, however, no such breed as the “French Poodle.” In France, Poodles are known as the Caniche, or “duck dog.”Despite the Poodle’s association with France, the breed originated as a duck hunter in Germany, where the word “pudelin” refers to splashing in water. The Standard Poodle began its development as a retrieving water dog more than 400 years ago. With a crisp, curly coat as protection against the elements, superlative swimming ability, and off-the-charts intelligence, the Poodle was, and still is, a magnificent retriever. (The Standard is the only breed classified as a non-sporting dog that is eligible for AKC Retriever Hunting Tests.)The flamboyant Poodle show coat served a practical purpose in the breed’s early years. Hunters wanted their dogs to have free range of movement in the water, but they also wished to protect vital areas of the anatomy from the cold. They shaved the legs, neck, and tail but left the chest, hips, and leg joints coated. The rounded tufts on the legs, hips, and tail tip are called pompons. (Note the spelling: Cheerleaders have pom-poms; Poodles have pompons.)The Poodle’s many fine qualities allowed it to move from the lake to the lap of luxury. Elegant Poodles of the Standard and Miniature varieties found favor among the nobles of France and, eventually, all of Europe. The breed’s showy looks and trainability made it a natural entertainer, and Poodles have long been associated with the European circus tradition.

newfoundland,Newfoundland,"28 inches (male), 26 inches (female)","130-150 pounds (male), 100-120 pounds (female)",9-10 years,Pinscher and Schnauzer,canada,"Canadian fisherman long relied on Newfoundlands as peerless shipboard working dogs who specialized in dramatic water rescues. Newfs are born swimmers, complete with partially webbed feet, and strong enough to save a grown man from drowning. Their prowess as rescuers is the stuff of legend: What the Saint Bernard is to the Alps, the Newfoundland is to the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Newfs also earned their keep by hauling fishing nets to shore and carting the day’s catch to market. Although the Newf’s career as a seagoing deckhand is mostly a thing of the past, the breed is still considered the premium water-rescue dog and is employed in that role the world over.The Newf is one of the world’s most beloved breeds, and history is rife with examples of their dedication to humankind. In 1802, when Lewis and Clark began their historic 8,000-mile trek across the American continent, a Newfoundland named Seaman was part of the expedition. He was useful as a hunter and guard dog, once saving lives by running off a rogue buffalo that was charging the camp. Today, Seaman is depicted in 10 different Lewis and Clark monuments across the country.A well-visited tourist attraction in England, where Newfs have always been a great favorite, is a monument erected by Lord Byron at Newstead Abbey for his cherished Newf, Boatswain. The monument’s inscription, devised by the great poet himself, eulogizes Boatswain, “Who possessed Beauty without Vanity/Strength without Insolence/Courage without Ferocity/And all the Virtues of Man without his Vices.” Such was Byron’s regard for his Newf that Boatswain’s tomb at the abbey is larger than his own.A Newfoundland named Brumus burnished his breed’s “nanny dog” reputation by helping Senator and Mrs. Robert F. Kennedy look after their 11 children.","Black,Brown,Gray,White & Black,Beige,Black & Tan,White & Brown,White & Gray"

The result was a dog possessing the fire of a true terrier but with a beguiling toy-breed personality. They began as barnyard ratters but soon found their way to show business, where their cleverness, grace, and nifty looks served them well as circus trick dogs. Today they perform at championship levels in competitive agility.","White & Black,White & Tan,White Black & Tan,White, Chocolate & Tan,White & Chocolate"

The water variety consisted of the now extinct Tweed Water Spaniel as well as English and Irish breeds. In Ireland prior to the 1850s, two different water spaniel strains existed: the South Country Water Spaniel and the North Country Water Spaniel. The Irish Water Spaniel as we know it today developed from both of these strains, but most closely resembles the South Country type.Beginning in the 1830s, Justin McCarthy, a sportsman from Dublin, refined the type away from its aforementioned varieties and into a distinct and repeatable breed. His dog, Boatswain, was the first purebred IWS. By 1859, the Irish Water Spaniel began to appear in dog shows.The popularity of the IWS grew quickly with English and Irish sportsmen due to its retrieves, disposition, and its ability to handle the cold waters of the North Sea. Soon, word spread to America and in the 1870s, a number of dogs were imported. By 1875, the Irish Water Spaniel became the third most popular sporting breed in the US.",Liver

The setter was developed to lay down quietly, or “set,” when they located birds. This style of hunting at the time would then require the hunter to cast a net in the area, sometimes covering the dog as well, and flush and harvest the birds that were ensnared there. The 19th century saw a divergence of Setters into different breeds, evolving based on their location and the terrain in which they hunted. The Gordon Setter’s heavy bone and square frame suggests its usefulness in the difficult, craggy landscape of Scotland.An important figure in this breed’s development was Alexander Gordon, the Fourth Duke of Gordon and a setter fancier (d. 1827), who founded a kennel of “Black and Tan Setters” at Gordon Castle. Though his early dogs looked more like the English Setter, crosses with the flat-coated black and tan collie, Bloodhounds, black Pointers, and solid-black setters helped mold the Gordon Setter breed into what it is today.The United States saw its first import of Gordon Setters in 1842 when George Blunt of New York brought a male and female named Rake and Rachael.In 1872, the British Kennel Club declared the Black and Tan Setter an official breed. In 1878, the breed was registered in America as well and recognized by the AKC in 1884. Eight years after that, the AKC changed the breed’s name from the Gordon Castle Setter to the Gordon Setter. It was not until January 1, 1924 that the Kennel Club accepted the Gordon Setter name as well.","Black & Tan,Red,Tan"

scotch_terrier,Scotch Terrier,10 inches,"19-22 pounds (male), 18-21 pounds (female)",12 years,Terriers,great britain,"Developed to hunt rats, foxes, and badgers on the craggy Scottish Highlands, the Scottish Terrier is a venerable breed. In fact, it is thought to be the oldest of the Highland terriers. And one authority calls the breed “the oldest variety of the canine race indigenous to Britain.” At various times in the breed’s long history there has been controversy about its origins and type. In fact, dog folks spent much of the 1800s arguing over what was a Scottish Terrier and what was a terrier that happened to be Scottish. Despite his humble farm-dog origins, the Scottie had friends in high places. In the 17th century, England’s King James I, a Scot by birth, was well acquainted with the breed and gave them as gifts.The first Scottie imports arrived in America in 1883, and two years later the AKC registered its first Scottie, a male named Prince Charlie. The Scottie’s peak of popularity was the 1930s and early ’40s, with such celebrity owners as Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis under the spell of the breed’s spicy charm. The Scottie silhouette is a familiar motif of Depression-era knickknacks and advertising, and the image is still popular today with textile makers looking for a sporty retro-kitsch accent for their designs. History’s most famous Scottie was Fala, the constant companion of President Franklin Roosevelt during World War II.","Black,Brindle,Wheaten"

The breed’s ancestors were originally bred in northeastern Asia by the Chukchi people and were kept as companion dogs for their families as well as endurance sled dogs.When changing climate conditions forced the semi-nomadic Chukchi to expand their hunting grounds or perish, they rose to the challenge by developing a sled dog capable of hauling light loads over vast expanses of frozen wasteland in sub-zero temperatures, with a minimum expenditure of energy. The Chukchi, isolated from the rest of the world, were able to maintain the purity of their sled teams for many generations. The dogs they developed were the direct forerunners of today’s Siberian Husky.Siberians caught the eye of the public when they began winning sled races in the early 1900s, but they made headlines in 1925 when a legendary musher Leonhard Seppala led a relay of Siberian Huskies 658 miles in only five and a half days to rush a lifesaving serum to Nome, Alaska, where an epidemic of diphtheria had broken out. The thrilling “serum run,” reported breathlessly in newspapers around the world, won Siberians a popularity that has not abated to this day. Balto, who was Seppala’s lead dog on the final leg of the journey, remains one of the most honored hero dogs in canine history; a statue of him stands in New York City’s Central Park.Mushers still keep packs of sledding Siberians for fun and sport throughout North America. Less adventurous devotees of the breed simply enjoy the company of this sociable, gentle companion.","Agouti & White,Black,Black & White,Black Tan & White,Brown & White,Gray & White,Red & White,Sable & White,White,Piebald"

bluetick,Bluetick,"22-27 inches (male), 21-25 inches (female)","55-80 pounds (male), 45-65 pounds (female)",11-12 years,Not recognized,United States,"Dogs classified as hounds were bred to pursue warm-blooded quarry. Hounds can be either “sighthounds” or “scenthounds.” Sighthounds (Whippets  and Greyhounds, for example) use keen vision and speed to spot and pursue prey. Scenthounds—whether a Beagle pursuing a rabbit, or a Bloodhound on human scent—use an uncanny sense of smell to follow a trail over a distance to locate their quarry. Blueticks and their coon-dog cousins are scenthounds.Like all coonhound breeds, the Bluetick is an American creation. Bluetick bloodlines are said to extend back to before the founding of the country, specifically to French staghounds given to George Washington as a gift from his great friend, the Marquis de Lafayette. These were huge, ponderous dogs, easy to follow on foot. Breeders mixed in some English Foxhound along with a few other hound breeds to develop a high-endurance and meticulous hunter with a “cold nose.” (This is coon-hunter lingo describing a dog capable of working scent trails that are hours, even days, old.)These early Blueticks were used by frontiersmen in pursuit of the wily raccoon, but were often expected to work in packs as a big-game hunter on such dangerous quarry as bear, wild boar, lynx, and cougar. In the early 20th century, Fred Gipson, author of “Old Yeller,” wrote about a line of famous Blueticks: “In this breeding they’ve got a big, bell-voiced hound with a nose that can pick up a week-old trail, the endurance to run that trail 30 hours at a stretch, and the lusty courage that’ll make him tackle anything that won’t take a tree before he catches him.”The breed has changed little since Gipson’s time. Blueticks are still a coon hunter’s delight, and they are still fixtures in Southern culture. Since 1953, the Bluetick Coonhound has been the University of Tennessee’s sports mascot.",Blue Ticked & Tan
cairn,Cairn,"10 inches (male), 9.5 inches (female)","14 pounds (male), 13 pounds (female)",13-15 years,Terriers,great britain,"The Cairn is one of several terrier breeds, some still extant others now extinct, who for centuries patrolled the game preserves and farms of Scotland. Unravelling the histories of these breeds is difficult because for so many years they were lumped together as simply Scotch terriers. Not until the late 1800s did breed fanciers devise strict breeding programs and classifications for this hardy family of exterminators. The name Cairn Terrier did not appear in print until 1887, though by then the Cairn-type terrier had been around for a long time. Cairns were known from at least the 1600s to dwell in the Western Highlands, most notably on the Isle of Skye, birthplace of their kinsman the Skye Terrier.Once upon a time in Scotland, a mound of stones used as a boundary or to mark a grave was called a “cairn.” On Highland game preserves, rodents would live within and beneath these rock piles. The Cairn Terrier, among the smallest of the go-to-ground terriers, was developed to dig into cairns and rout out the critters. When grouped in packs, these plucky little hunters also worked on foxes, otters, and other predators. The Cairn’s independence, courage, toughness, and alertness were qualities that served them well when digging into a cairn alone and confronting sharp-toothed mammals.By the turn of the 20th century, Britain’s terrier fanciers had sorted out the various Scotch earthdogs and began breeding Cairn, Scottish, Skye, and West Highland White terriers as distinct pure breeds. Cairns were exhibited at British dog shows of the era, and the AKC recognized the breed in 1913.The breed’s public profile received a tremendous boost in 1939, when a Cairn named Terry was chosen to play Toto in MGM’s production of “The Wizard of Oz.”","Black,Brindle,Cream,Gray,Red,Silver,Wheaten"
pekinese,Pekinese,6-9 inches,up to 14 pounds,12-14 years,Companion and Toy Dogs,china,"A Chinese legend says the Pekingese was created by the Buddha, who shrunk a lion down to dog size. The breed is of such antiquity that we will never know its true beginnings, but the fanciful origin myth does contain a grain of probable truth. The Peke was likely bred down to toy size from a larger dog, not by the Buddha, of course, but by his earthly servants, the Chinese emperors and their courtiers. For many centuries, Chinese nobles were preoccupied with the breeding of flat-faced lapdogs. The Peke, Pug, and Shih Tzu are surviving samples of their handiwork. It is said that stealing one of these dogs was a crime punishable by death.Pekes were unknown to the West until 1860, when British troops invaded Peking (Beijing) during the Opium Wars. As the Brits stormed the emperor’s magnificent summer palace with the intention of looting and burning it, the royal family killed their Pekes rather than see them fall into enemy hands. A British captain discovered the emperor’s aunt dead, a suicide, but five of her Pekes were still alive, hiding behind a drapery. The dogs were returned to England as a gift for a delighted Queen Victoria, and the breed quickly caught on among her subjects.By the late 1890s, Pekes had arrived in America. They were first registered by the AKC in 1906. Six years later, the breed made headlines when a Pekingese was one of only three dogs to survive the sinking of the Titanic.","Biscuit,Black,Black & Tan,Cream,Fawn,Gray,Red,White,Parti-Color"
boston_bull,Boston Bull,15-17 inches,12-25 pounds,11-13 years,Companion and Toy Dogs,united states of america,"The popularity of blood sports in 19th-century England led to a mania for crossing terriers and bull-type breeds to produce dogs who could excel at pit fighting and ratting contests. In Liverpool, sometime in the late 1860s, a cross between a Bulldog and the now-extinct white English Terrier resulted in a tough, muscular dog named Judge.Judge’s owner sold him to an American named William O’Brien, who brought his new dog home to Boston. In 1870, O’Brien sold Judge to a fellow Bostonian, Robert C. Hooper. Judge, from then on known in breed histories as “Hooper’s Judge,” became the patriarch of the Boston Terrier breed and the common ancestor of almost all true Bostons.A breed historian describes Judge as a “strongly built, high stationed dog of about thirty-two pounds weight. In color he was a dark brindle, with a white stripe in the face. His head was square and blocky, and he resembled the present Boston Terrier in that he had a nearly even mouth.”Hooper bred Judge to a small white female named Burnett’s Gyp, owned by Edward Burnett, of Southboro, Massachusetts. And, in the genealogy so familiar to Boston Terrier fanciers, Judge and Gyp begot Well’s Eph, who begot Tobin’s Kate, and on through the seminal generations of the Boston’s U.S. history. During the breed’s formative decades, selective breeding transformed the bulky fighter of Judge’s time into a smaller, sweeter, and more attractive companion dog, originally called the Round Head by its partisans.In honor of the city where these happy-go-lucky dogs were so painstakingly developed, the breed name was changed to Boston Terrier. The Boston Terrier Club of America was formed in 1891, and two years later the AKC registered its first dog of the breed.To this day, Boston Terriers are a point of hometown pride. The Boston Terrier has been the official mascot of Boston University for nearly 100 years, and in 1979 the state legislature named the “American Gentleman” the official dog of Massachusetts.","Black & White,Black Brindle & White,Brindle & White,Seal & White,Seal Brindle & White"
dandie_dinmont,Dandie Dinmont,15-17 inches,12-25 pounds,11-13 years,Terriers,great britain,"The terrier that would become known as the Dandie Dinmont made its debut in written history in about 1700. Described as a “rough native terrier owned by border hunters in the Cheviot Hills between England and Scotland,” the breed was said to be especially good at dispatching such four-legged poachers as otter and badger.Sir Walter Scott, Scotland’s foremost novelist, was an admirer of the breed. For his 1815 novel “Guy Mannering,” he created a character named Dandie Dinmont, a farmer who keeps a pack of curious-looking pepper and mustard terriers. Scott based the fictional Dinmont on a real-life breeder of such dogs, James Davidson, who kept a pack of working terriers—Old Mustard, Young Pepper, Young Mustard, Little Pepper, Little Mustard, and Old Pepper—the “immortal six” still spoken of with reverence by Dandie fanciers. (It is said that every Dandie alive today can be traced back to a dog named Old Ginger, sired by Old Pepper.) In acknowledgement of the exposure the breed received from Scott, who called it the “big little dog,” these bright-eyed, long-backed earthdogs came to be known as Dandie Dinmont’s terriers. They remain the only AKC breed named for a fictional character. Dandies caught the attention of 19th-century royals, such as French king Louis Philippe, who kept a brace of pampered Dandies as part of his royal entourage. England’s Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club, established in 1875, is still in operation today as one of the world’s oldest breed clubs. The Dandie entered the AKC in 1886, and retains a small but steadfast following.","Mustard, Pepper"
kelpie,Kelpie,17-20 inches," 31–44 pounds"," 10-13 years",Sheepdogs and Cattledogs (except Swiss Cattledogs),australia,"Following the opening of vast areas of land in the Australian States of New South Wales and Victoria, the sheep numbers increased so dramatically that some properties were over two million acres and ran over a quarter of a million sheep. In areas as extensive as these, herding (originally carried out by convicts) was impractical, wire fences were erected and sheep were left to run free. It was then necessary to have dogs to handle sheep in such large areas. A dog had to be developed to work in the conditions present in Australia. These conditions included heat, rough terrain, dust storms and vast distances. The Kelpie being able to perform the work of several men, were tireless workers in the hottest and dustiest of climates.Like so many breeds, the origin of the Kelpie is disputed. There is no doubt, however, that the origin of the breed came from dogs imported from Scotland. These dogs were black and tan, longhaired with semi-pricked ears, medium-sized and of Collie type. Others were smooth-haired with erect ears, but still of Collie type. Litters from these dogs also produced red (liverbrown) puppies.","Black,Black & Tan,Blue,Chocolate,Fawn,Red,Red & Tan"

Even today, Bern’s website tells us, “Over 12,000 farms are spread over the canton’s valleys, hills, and mountain areas.”Berners earned their keep by droving cattle, guarding farmyards from predators, and serving as gentle companions when the hard work of the day was done. Perhaps their greatest claim to working-dog fame is their ability to pull many times their own weight as drafting dogs, with their broad and muscular hindquarters generating immense strength.Despite the breed’s great utility in the days before mechanized farming and ranching, by the late 1800s the Berner’s numbers were dwindling and the quality of the surviving dogs left something to be desired. A painstaking effort was begun by Swiss fanciers to reverse the breed’s decline.In 1907, a Swiss breed club was formed under the leadership of Professor Albert Heim, perhaps the most respected European dog man of his generation. Before long, Berners were once again a favored farm dog, and they also caught on as companions with Swiss householders.The breed’s American history began in 1926, when a Kansas farmer imported a pair as all-around farm dogs. They caught on quickly, and the AKC registered its first Berner in 1937. Today, the Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America sponsors drafting and carting events that test the working ability of these majestic mountaineers.","Black Rust & White,Black Tan & White,Black & Rust,Black & White,Rust & White"
