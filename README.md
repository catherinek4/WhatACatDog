<h1>WhatACat?Dog project</h1></br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Out task was to recognize a breed of a cat or a dog. We used 2 datasets for distinguishing these breeds. The first one is called The Oxford-IIIT PET dataset. There is a collection of 2371 images of cats and 12 cat breeds in general. The second dataset is the Stanford Dogs Dataset with 120 breeds. For each breed class there are ~150 images. So the content of the dataset is quite huge as the number of total images is 20,580.
