<h3>Introduction</h3>
Our task was to recognize a breed of a cat or a dog. We used 2 datasets for distinguishing these breeds. The first one is called The Oxford-IIIT PET dataset. There is a collection of 2371 images of cats and 12 cat breeds in general. The second dataset is the Stanford Dogs Dataset with 120 breeds. For each breed class there are ~150 images. So the content of the dataset is quite huge as the number of total images is 20,580.

  <h3>Recognition Model</h3>
  Our Neural Network receives an input (one single vector with 64*64 values) and transforms it using series of hidden layers. The last layer is a fully-connected layer and is called the output layer. For making a Recongnition Model we took into account Convolutional Neural Networks because of the fact it has a sensible architecture and each neuron is arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, and depth.
